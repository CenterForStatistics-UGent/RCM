# Introduction

The aim of this notebook is to wrap the codes to fit the RC(M) model with the negative binomial, zero-inflated poisson and zero-inflated negative binomial models. Also an overview of the theory is given here.

The underlying motivation is to develop a visualization technique for the microbiome that does not suffer from the defects of currently applied techniques such as PCA, PCoA with Bray-Curtis distance etc. These methods are in particular sensitive to differences in library size.

# Theory

## Unconstrained analysis

### Correspondence analysis

Suppose we have a $nxp$ count data matrix $\mathbf{X}$ with $n$ samples and $p$ taxa, with $i$ and $j$ row respectively column indices. The count matrix has been trimmed to exclude all-zero rows and columns.

#### Independence model

Under independence between rows and columns we model the counts in a contingency table as 

$$E(X_{ij}) = a_i b_j$$

whereby usually $a_i=x_{i.}=\sum_{j=1}^px_{ij}$ (the library sizes) and $b_j=\frac{x_{.j}}{x_{..}}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^nx_{ij}}{\sum_{j=1}^p\sum_{i=1}^nx_{ij}}$ (the average relative abundances).

#### Reconsitution formula of Correspondence Analysis (CA)

A more extended model is

$$E(X_{ij}) = a_i  b_j + c_i d_j \sum_{k=1}^K \omega_k v_{ki} w_{jk}$$.

For $a_i = c_i = x_{i.}$ and $b_j = d_j = \frac{x_{.j}}{x_{..}}$ this is regular correspondence analysis. The second term in the equation represents deviation from independence. This is called the *reconstitution formula* since it decomposes the observed average count into its expectation under independence and a residual. The residual is then further decomposed into $k$ pieces. The expected count can then be written as

$$E(X_{ij}) = \frac{x_{i.}x_{.j}}{x_{..}} \big(1 + \sum_{k=1}^K \omega_k v_{ki} w_{jk}\big)$$.

Regular corrsepondence analysis is done through singular value decomposition(SVD) of the matrix of weighted (Pearson) residuals

$$R^{-1/2}(X-E)C^{-1/2}=U\Sigma V$$

with $\Sigma$ a diagonal matrix with the singular values of $X$ on the diagnonal and $R$ and $C$ diagonal matrices with row and column sums.

In matrix notation the reconstitution formula becomes

$$X = E_{independence} + R^{1/2}U\Sigma VC^{1/2}$$

with $\mathbf{1'}R^{1/2}U=\mathbf{0}$ and $\mathbf{1'}C^{1/2}V=\mathbf{0}$ (weighted means equal zero) and $U'R^{1/2}U=\mathbf{1}$ and $V'C^{1/2}V=\mathbf{1}$ (weighted variances equal one) (see VanDerHeijden et al., 1985).

For plotting usually $\omega_1 \mathbf{v_{1}}$ is plotted versus $\omega_2 \mathbf{v_{2}}$ to correctly represent the distances between the samples. $\mathbf{w_{1}}$ and $\mathbf{w_{2}}$ can then be added to construct a biplot. The orthogonal projection of $(\omega_1 v_{ki}, \omega_2 v_{ki})$ on $(w_{j1},w_{j2})$ then equals $\frac{(\omega_1 v_{ki}, \omega_2 v_{ki})^t(w_{j1},w_{j2})}{||(w_{j1},w_{j2})||}$. This value is proportional to the departure from the independence model of taxon $j$ in sample $i$ in dimension $k$ ($(\omega_1 v_{ki}, \omega_2 v_{ki})^t(w_{j1},w_{j2}) = \omega_1 v_{ki} w_{j1} + \omega_2 v_{ki} w_{j2}$), with the norm of the species vector as proportionality constant.

Note that the use of correspondence analysis implies unimodal response curves (see later). Hence it is not appropriate to represent species as arrows. Representing them as points is more appropriate.

Correspondence analysis has been criticised for putting undue emphasis on rare species (Legendre and Gallagher, 2001).

#### Skewness

Because of the skewness of the distribution, the residuals are also very skewed. If we have an expectation of around 1, it is very likely to observe a zero, but much less likely to observe a 2. Still both deviations are weighted equally. I think a residual-based approach is ill suited to asymmetric, skewed data. Also the library size correction will never be appropriate, so that part of the biplot will reflect differences in library sizes. We considered decomposing

$$R^{-1}(X-E)C^{-1}$$

in the past to account for the fact that the data are not Poisson ($Var(X) = E(X)$) but rather negative binomial ($Var(X) = E(X) + \phi*E(X)^2$) and thus the variance for large means proportional to the squared expectation. Even more general we considered

$$R^{-a}(X-E)C^{-b}$$

and estimate $a$ and $b$ by maximum likelihood but we did not really see how to go on from here.

### Hellinger distance

With PCoA, any distance metric can be used to produce a distance matrix, which can be decomposed to make biplots.

The Hellinger distance divides by the square root of the observation as means of normalization:

$$\frac{X}{\sqrt{Var(X)}} \approx \frac{X}{\sqrt{X}} = \sqrt{X}$$

The rationale is that each observation x is the best estimate of its expectation E(X), and under the Poisson model also of its variance. Still also these plots are susceptible to differences in library sizes.

### Log-linear analysis

Another modelling approach is to use log-linear modelling an thereby introduce the negative binomial as error term. We know from previous goodness of fit testing that this is an appropriate error model for microbiome data.

In log-linear analysis the logged expected count $l_{ij}$ is modelled as

$$log(E(X_{ij})) = l_{ij} = u + u_i + u_j + u_{ij}$$.

For $u_{ij} \neq 0$ this is the saturated model, which provides a perfect fit by setting all expected values equal to the observed ones. If $u_{ij} = 0$ this is the independence model presented above.

### The RC(M)-association model

For the purpose of making biplots, we might consider the following model (proposed by Leo Goodman, 1985. See also VanDerHeijden 1994)

$$log(E(x_{ij})) = l_{ij} = u + u_i + u_j + \psi_1r_{1i}s_{1j} + \psi_2r_{2i}s_{2j}$$

or in matrix form:

$$\mathbf{lE} = \mathbf{u_{sam,MLE}}\mathbf{u_{tax,MLE}}^t + \mathbf{r}_k \boldsymbol{\psi}_k \mathbf{s}_k^t$$

with $\mathbf{lE}$ the n-by-p matrix of logged expectations, $\mathbf{u_{sam,MLE}}$ the vector with length $n$ with the row intercepts estimated by ML, $\mathbf{u_{tax,MLE}}$ the vector of length $p$ with the column intercepts estimated by ML, $\mathbf{r}_k$ the n-by-k matrix of row scores, $\boldsymbol{\psi}_k$ a diagonal matrix with the $k$ $\psi$'s on the diagonal and $\mathbf{s}_k$ the p-by-k matrix of column scores

Constraints are needed to render this model identifiable, since we have three unknown regressors ($r_{ik}, s_{jk} and psi_k$) instead of one. We do restrict the importance parameter $psi_k$ to be positive, and center the (weighted) row and column scores around 0, which is a useful property for the biplot and is also the case for correspondence analysis. In addition the row and column scores are restricted to have (weighted) variance 1. $psi_k$ is the only parameter that can grow in size without restriction. As a result it will automatically figure as a measure of importance of the departure from independence in that direction, since all scores of the dimensions are normalized. This is also the case for correspondence analysis. Thridly, the scores of the different dimensions are orthogonal, so the solutions in different dimensions are linearly independent.

Centering:

$$\sum_{i=1}^nw_ir_{ki} = 0$$

with k=1,2 and

Normalization($k=k'$) and orthogonality ($k \neq k'$)

$$\sum_{i=1}^nw_ir_{ki}r_{k'i} = I(k=k')$$

$$\sum_{j=1}^pz_js_{kj} = 0$$

$$\sum_{j=1}^pz_js_{kj}s_{k'j} = I(k=k')$$
Hereby $w_i$ and $z_j$ are row and column weigths.

#### RC(M)-weights

The weights can be regarded as probability density functions, they represent the likelihood of sampling a certain sample or taxon from the population. On the population level we could say that

$$E(w_iX_{ik}) = 0$$,

i.e. the average row score on the population level is zero. This is a useful restriction to make sure that the biplot is centered around zero. Analogously we want that

$$E(w_iX_{ik}X_{ik'}) = I(k=k')$$

and accordingly for the column scores. But which weights $w_i$ and $z_j$ should we use?

Goodman proposes to use $w_i = x_{i.}$ and $z_j = x_{.j}$ thus uses _weighted_ constraints, to retain the relationship with correspondence analysis (see below). Becker _et al._ (1989) recommend using uniform weights not to let the marginal distribution affect the model fit. 

For the microbiome case, every subject comes from the same population under the null-hypothesis and all subjects are thus eqaully likely to be sampled and have the same importance. The library sizes as a purely technical artefact, unrelated to the biological importance of the subject. Consequently we use uniform row weights $w_i = 1/n$ (or $w_i = 1$, the magnitude is of no importance since the associated $\psi_k$ will grow or shrink accordingly). However, some taxa are more prevalent in the population than others. We want the average column scores on the population level to be centered around zero, have variance one and be orthogonal. That is why we set

$$E(z_j S_{jk}) = 0$$

$$E(z_j S_{jk} S_{jk'}) = I(k=k')$$

Because the more abundant species are in fact more abundant in the population as a whole (as opposed to samples with a large library size) it makes sense to use a marginal weighting scheme for the column scores. The weights $z_j$ will be estimated by maximum likelihood, as explained in the next paragraph.

#### RC(M) margins

The most logical choices for the margins and the independence model have long seemed to use $u=-log(x_{..})$, $u_i = log(x_{i.})$ and $u_j = log(x_{.j})$.

However, the library sizes do not correspond to the maximum likelihood estimate of $u_i$ under the Negative Binomial model. As a result the first dimensional row scores $r_{1i}$ tried to correct for this effect and became related (linearly correlated) to the library sizes, which we want to avoid absolutley. 

To avoid this we set $u=0$ and estimate the $u_i$'s, $u_j$'s and overdispersions iteratively using maximum likelihood in a first step (this converges very quickly). The main disadvantage I see of this approach is that the independence model becomes model dependent. Next we'll have to iterate between fitting the overdispersions, the imporance parameters $\psi$, the $r's$ and the $s's$. Hereby we use marginal weights for the taxa ($z_j = exp(u_j)$) and uniform weights for the rows. 

In practice, the marginal sums differ more from the MLE for the library sizes than for the taxon abundances. We can think of the following mathematical explanation: when calculating library sizes or abundances by row and column sums, each observations receives the same weight. However, when we estimate the margins through ML, we solve the following score equations:

$$\frac{\partial L(\mathbf{X}_i|\mathbf{u}_{i}, \mathbf{u}_j, \boldsymbol{\theta})}{\partial u_{i}} = \sum_{j=1}^p \frac{y_{ij}-\mu_{ij}}{1+\frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j}}$$

$$\frac{\partial L(\mathbf{X}_i|\mathbf{u}_{i}, \mathbf{u}_j, \boldsymbol{\theta})}{\partial u_{j}} = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{y_{ij}-\mu_{ij}}{1+\frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j}}.$$

Note that since we are estimating offsets the value of the regressor is 1. In this case the difference of $y_{ij}$ with the expected value $\mu_{ij}$ is weighted by a factor $\frac{1}{1+\frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j}} = \frac{\theta_j}{\theta_j+\mu_{ij}}$. When estimating $u_j$, $\theta$ is a constant but when estimating $u_i$ it is different for every observation $y_{ij}$. Hence the weights put on every observation differ much more when estimating the sample offsets than when estimating the taxon offsets. That is the reason why the MLE differs more from the marginal sum for the library size than for the abundances.

#### Imposing the restrictions

The centering, normalization and orthogonality of the row and column scores are enforced through Lagrange multipliers. This makes the systems of equations harder to solve but assures independence of the dimensions.

#### A note on gradient analysis

Note that this is a case of __indirect gradient__ analysis: the dimensions are estimated without incorporating gradient information (measured covariates) to maximally represent variability in the data. In a next step these obtained gradients can be compared with measured covariates (often graphically through a colour code) to see how well these covariates explain the gradients. 

#### Relationship between CA and log-linear analysis

According to Escoufier, 1985 if $a =\sum_{k=1}^K \omega_k v_{ki} w_{jk}$ is small (i.e. the deviation from independence is small) then $log(1+a) \approx a$ and

$$log(E(x_{ij})) = log(x_{i.}) + log(x_{.j}) - log(x_{..}) + log\big(1 + \sum_{k=1}^K \omega_k v_{ki} w_{jk}\big) \approx log(x_{i.}) + log(x_{.j}) - log(x_{..}) + \sum_{k=1}^K \omega_k v_{ki} w_{jk}$$

i.e. an equivalence between the RC(M)-model and correspondence analysis

Since the same restricitions apply to the scores $v_{ki}$ and $w_{jk}$ as to U and V, we can state that  $\psi_k \approx \omega_k$. The assumption that the departure from independence is small seems unlikely in our case, but it does provide us with some starting values.

### Fitting the RC(M) model

The models are usually fitted by ML. See page 55 of Goodman 1985 for details. Goodman assumed a Poisson distribution, but it might be possible to use a negative binomial model with unique dispersions for each taxon $j$ as well.

See Goodman 1985 (appendix), Becker 1988 for information on estimation. The code below is generic but we take k=2 for simplicity.

Parameters of interest to estimate are $\psi$, $r_1$, $r_2$, $c_1$, $c_2$. In the process we'll also need the nuisance parameters $\mathbf{\theta}$ and the offsets of the independence model $u_i$ and $u_j$. Assume $E(X_{ij}) = \mu_{ij}$ and  $Var(X_{ij})=\mu_{ij} + \frac{\mu_{ij}^2}{\theta}$

#### The negative binomial density function

For the sake of completeness we give the density function of the negative binomial distribution (see Lawless, 1987) in the ($\mu$, $\theta$) parametrization whereby $E(X_{ij}) = \mu_{ij}$ and $Var(X_{ij}) = \mu_{ij} + \frac{\mu_{ij}^2}{\theta_j}$ .

$$f_{NB}(X_{ij}) = \frac{\Gamma(X_{ij}+\theta_j)}{\Gamma(\theta_j)} \big(\frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j+\mu_{ij}}\big)^{X_{ij}} \big(\frac{\theta_j}{\theta_j+\mu_{ij}}\big)^{\theta_j}$$

#### Starting values

1. Obtain a singular value decomposition as $R^{-c}(X-E)C^{-d} = U\Sigma V$. This gives us initial values $[r_{11}^{init}, r_{12}^{init},..., r_{1i}^{init}] = U_{(1.)}$, the first row of $U$, and correspondingly $\Sigma$ and $V$ give initial values for $\mathbf{\psi}$ and $\mathbf{s}$. The values for $c$ and $d$ depend ont he weighting scheme used, e.g. if the sample weights are uniform ($w_i=1/n$) and the taxon weights marginal($z_j = x_{.j}$) then $c=1$ and $d=0$. This makes sure the initial centering conditions are fulfilled.

We still need to ensure that the (weighted) variances equal 1, so we set

$$r_{ki}^{init} = \big(\frac{w_ir_{ki}^{SVD}}{\sum_{i=1}^n{r^{SVD}_{ki}}^2w_i}\big)^{1/2}$$

and

$$s_{ik}^{init} = \big(\frac{z_js_{ik}^{SVD}}{\sum_{i=1}^n{s^{SVD}_{ik}}^2z_j}\big)^{1/2}$$

#### Iteration

2. If the independence model is estimated by MLE, estimate the $u_i$'s, $u_j$'s and $\theta_j$'s iteratively until convergence (set $u=0$). The estimating equeations are independent (Jacobian is diagonal) so this converges very quickly. Otherwise set $u_i = log(x_{i.})$ , $u_j = log(x_{.j})$ and $u = log(x_{..})$.

3. Estimate overdispersions

Theoretically we might estimate the dispersions by ML, but the estimates are very variable, which dramatically affects the rest of the fitting procedure.

 - Maximum likelihood estimation (not used) 
 
$$log(E(x_{ij})) = l_{ij} = offset\big(log(\frac{x_{i.}x_{.j}}{x_{..}}  \big) + \psi_1 (s_{1i}^{init}r_{1j}^{init}) + \psi_2 (s_{2i}^{init}r_{2j}^{init})\big)$$

to obtain estimates for the overdispersions $\theta_j$, whereby the means $\mu_{ij}$ are assumed known

 $$\sum_{i=1}^n \sum^{y_i^*}_{t=0} \big( \frac{t}{1+\frac{t}{\theta_j} } \big) + \theta_j^2 log(1+\frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j})- \mu_{ij}\frac{y_{ij}+\theta_j}{1+\frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j} }$$
 
 For this we can use the theta.ml() function in the _MASS_ package
 
 - edgeR robust
 
To get more stable estimates of the dispersions, RNA-seq packages such as _DESeq_ and _edgeR_ use an empirical Bayes approach to shrink dispersion estimates towards a fitted mean-dispersion trend. Here I use the machinery of edgeR robust (version `r packageVersion("edgeR")`) to estimate the dispersions
 
To reduce the computational cost and because the estimates do not change a lot anyway the estimation of the overdispersions is not repeated in every iteration

4. Estimate the psi parameters
 
 Solve the system of score equations (see Lawless 1987) for $\psi_1$ and $\psi_2$, assuming $\theta_j$'s given
 
 $$\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^p r_{im}s_{mj} \frac{y_{ij}-\mu_{ij}}{1+\frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j}} = 0$$ for all m=1,...,k
 
 with
 
 $$E(X_{ij}) = \mu_{ij} = exp\big(log(\frac{x_{i.}x{.j}}{x_{..}}) + \psi_1^{MLE} s_{1j}^{init}r_{1i}^{init} + \psi_2^{MLE} s_{2j}^{init}r_{2i}^{init} \big)$$.
 
 These are non-linear equations for which we use the _nleqslv_ package, with its default the Broyden method. This is a variation of the Newton-Raphson method (or Fisher scoring in case of ML) whereby the Jacobian is recycled and not recalculated at every iteration. The Jacobian is a square matrix of dimension k*(k-1)/2. The diagonal entry at position $kk'$ is:
 
 $$\frac{\delta^2 L_{NB}(\mu, \theta)}{\delta \psi_k \delta \psi_{k'}} = -\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^p r_{ik}r_{ik'}s_{kj}s_{k'j}\frac{\mu_{ij}(1+\frac{x_{ij}}{\theta_j})}{(1+\frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j})^2}$$
 
5. Estimate the row scores. 

To estimate the $r_{i}$'s we would like to use weighted least squares to minimize

$$\sum_{j=1}^p\Big(log(x_{ij}) - \big(u + u_i + u_j +\sum_{k=1}^M r_{ik} \big( \hat{\psi_ks_{jk}} \big)\Big)^2$$

for every $i$. Unfortunately we cannot calculate $log(x_{ij})$ because of the zeroes.

We'll have to use another way to estimate them, maximum likelihood in our case. I don't like using weighted least squares on the non-transformed counts,

$$\sum_{j=1}^p\Big(x_{ij} - exp\big(u + u_i + u_j +\sum_{k=1}^M r_{ik} \big( \hat{\psi_ks_{jk}} \big)\Big)^2,$$

because of the skewness of the residuals as explained above.

To enforce the constraints on the row scores one option would be to estimate all scores through full maximum likelihood and then modify a few of them to make them satisfy the constraints and repeat until convergence. This runs into numerical problems though, because the modified scores are usually very large initially which leads to overflow when exponenttiated. Instead we use the methods of the Lagrange multipliers to implement the constraints. We thus seek to maximize the Lagrangian function

$$Lag(r_{ik}, \mathbf{\lambda}) = L_{NB}(\mathbf{r}) + \sum_{k=1}^M \big( \lambda_{1k} \sum_{i=1}^n w_i r_{ik} \big) + \sum_{k=1}^M \big( \lambda_{2k} ( \sum_{i=1}^n w_i r_{ik}^2 ) - 1 \big) + \sum_{k \neq k'} \big(\lambda_{3kk'} \sum_{i=1}^n (w_ir_{ik}r_{ik'}) \big)$$

with $L_{NB}(\mathbf{r})$ the log-likelihood function of the negative binomial regression. The derivatives of this function for the following system of equations

$$\frac{\partial Lag(r_{ik}, \mathbf{\lambda})}{\partial r_{ik}} = \sum_{j=1}^p \hat{s}_{jk} \hat{\psi}_k \frac{y_{ij}-\mu_{ij}}{1+\frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j}} + \sum_{k=1}^M w_i \lambda_{1k}  + \sum_{k=1}^M \big(2 \lambda_{2k} w_ir_{ik}\big) +  \sum_{k' \neq k} w_ir_{ki} \lambda_{kk'} = 0$$

and 

$$\frac{\partial Lag(r_{ik}, \mathbf{\lambda})}{\partial \lambda_{1k}} = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i r_{ik} = 0$$

and 

$$\frac{\partial Lag(r_{ik}, \mathbf{\lambda})}{\partial \lambda_{2k}} = (\sum_{i=1}^n w_i r_{ik}^2) - 1 = 0$$

and 

$$\frac{\partial Lag(r_{ik}, \mathbf{\lambda}))}{\partial \lambda_{3kk'}} = (\sum_{i=1}^n w_i r_{ik}r_{ik'}) - 1 = 0$$

. The latter three groups of equations represent the original centering, normalization and orthogonality constraints. 

There are additional equations in the system now, but also as many extra $\lambda$ parameter to optimize. These $\lambda$ parameters are also stored and used as initial values in the next iteration run. There size represent the extent to which the constraints pull away the solution from the optimal, unconstrained solution, but I don't see how we can use that in a biologically or statistically meaningful way.

We now truly have a system of equations to solve, which we do with the _nleqslv_ package. It is straightforward but a bit cumbersome to also provide the analytical Jacobian, which greatly speeds up the iterations (otherwise it has to be approximated numerically). The Jacobian is sparse and symmetric. with following non-zero entries:

 $$\frac{\delta^2 Lag(\mu, \theta)}{ \delta r_{ik} \delta r_{ik'}} = -\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^p \psi_{k}\psi_{k'}s_{kj}s_{k'j}\frac{\mu_{ij}(1+\frac{x_{ij}}{\theta_j})}{(1+\frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j})^2}=0$$
 
  $$\frac{\delta^2 Lag(\mu, \theta)}{\delta r_{ik} \delta \lambda_{1k}} = w_i$$
  
  $$\frac{\delta^2 Lag(\mu, \theta)}{\delta r_{ik} \delta \lambda_{2k}} = 2w_ir_{ik}$$
  
  $$\frac{\delta^2 Lag(\mu, \theta)}{\delta r_{ik} \delta \lambda_{3kk'}} = w_ir_{ik'}$$
  
  All other entries are zero.
  
6. Estimate the column scores

Repeat step 4 but now estimate $s_{jk}$ column scores in the restrictions, e.g. the Lagrangian becomes:

$$Lag(s_{jk}, \mathbf{\lambda}) = L_{NB}(s_{jk}) + \sum_{k=1}^M \big( \lambda_{1k} \sum_{j=1}^p z_j s_{jk} \big) + \sum_{k=1}^M \big( \lambda_{2k}  ( \sum_{j=1}^p z_js_{jk}^2 ) - 1 \big) + \sum_{k \neq k'} \big(\lambda_{3kk'} \sum_{j=1}^p (z_js_{jk}s_{jk'}) - 1\big)$$

#### Termination

7. Repeat steps 3-6 until convergence. Convergence is assumed if between two iterations

 - None of the $\psi$ parameters change less than $0.01\%$ (infinity norm)
 
 AND
 
 - None of the square roots of the L2-norms of the relative changes of row and column scores exceeds 0.1%, or
 
 $$\forall \mathbf{r_k}, \mathbf{s_k} \Big(\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (1-\frac{r^{(iter-1)}_{ik}}{r^{(iter)}_{ik}})^2} < 0.001 \Big) \cup \Big( \sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^p (1-\frac{s^{(iter-1)}_{kj}}{s^{(iter)}_{kj}})^2} < 0.001 \Big)$$
 
 and analogously for all the scores. Other norms, such as L1 or infinity norms can also be used. A norm between 1 and 2 will lead to fast convergence.
 
 Overdispersions are not taken into account in determining the convergence since they're merely nuisance parameters.

#### Biplot

8. Plot $\psi_1r_{1i}$ vs $\psi_2r_{2i}$ as sample points and add $s_{1j}$ vs $s_{2j}$ as arrows to make a biplot. This assures that the orthogonal projection of the vector ($s_{1j}$, $s_{2j}$) on ($\psi_1r_{1i}$, $\psi_2r_{2i}$) equals $(s_{1j}, s_{2j})^t(\psi_1r_{1i}, \psi_2r_{2i}) = cos (\eta) (\sqrt{(\psi_1r_{1i})^2 + (\psi_2r_{2i})^2})$ with $\eta$ the angle between the two vectors. This projection represents the departure from independence in the first two dimensions combined. The larger the entries of the species and sample scores and the smaller the angle, the larger the departure of this taxon in this sample. The choice of $\psi_1r_{1i}$ vs $\psi_2r_{2i}$ assures the distances between samples are well represented, since more weight is added to differences in scores in important dimensions.

In the end we'll have estimated  p (abundances) + n (library sizes) + p (dispersions) + kxp (column scores) + kxn (row scores) + k (importance parameters) = (k+2)p + (k+1)xn + k parameters out of np entries. We have imposed 4k + k(k-1) restrictions, so the final model is still very parsimonious for n and p in the hundreds.

##### Model quality

9. Assess the goodness of fit

Since the model is overparametrized, classical ML theory (such as asymptotic behavious of maximum likelihood statistics) does not apply to our solution. Still we can compare the likelihoods of the independence, the RC(2) and the intermediate models to get an idea of the relative importance of the dimensions. The same concept exists for correspondence analysis, where the size of the diagonal elements of $\Sigma$ is proportional to the importance of the corresponding dimension. The log-likelihood of the saturated model is by definition equal to 0.

We can decompose the difference in log-likelihood between the independence and the full RC(K) model as

$$(LL_2 - LL_0) = (LL_1 - LL_0) + (LL_2 - LL_1)$$

with $LL_0$, $LL_1$ and $LL_2$ -2 the log-likelihoods of the independence, RC(1) and RC(2) models respectively. Scaling by $(LL_2 - LL_0)$ will provide interpretable fractions.

### One-by-one (1B1)

Initially all dimension were estimated jointly, but for reasons of speed we moved to a one-by-one approach estimating first the first dimension, then the second given the first, then the third given the first two and so on. By splitting the estimation procedures into smaller parts like this the estimation speeds up considerably, presumably because the systems are easier to solve.

### Confounders (Conditioning)

Sometimes some covariates are known to affect the abundances but one is not interested in their effect. We think first and foremost of technical parameters such as sequencing center or technology. We would like to condition on these parameters and visualize remainign variability.

#### Conditioning in correspondence analysis

Conditioning in correspondence analysis occurs by performing CCA with a confounder matrix Z as covariates, and then perform regular CA on the matrix of residuals.

#### Conditioning in the RCM approach

Thanks to our log-linear approach we can filter out the effect of these parameters by including interaction terms between the taxa and the confounding covariate to be filtered out. This willl occcur after fitting the independence model but before fitting the RC(M) component. We thus fit the following model in case of $c$ confounding variables:

 $$log(E(X_{ij})) = \lambda + \lambda_i + \lambda_j + \textcolor{red}{\sum_{l=1}^c \zeta_{jl}e_{il}} + \sum_{k=1}^M \psi_k r_{ik} s_{jk}$$
 
with $e_{il}$ the value of covariate $l$ in sample $i$ and $\zeta_{jl}$ the interaction parameter between taxon $j$ and confounding variable $l$. Note that we assume that the categorical variables have already been converted to multiple dummy variables.

#### Confounders and zero counts

Filtering out the effect of confounders brings the problems of the zeroes to the fore again. If a taxon has only zero counts in one of the subgroups defined by the confounding variables, the model will fail to fit, since the parameters $\zeta_{jl}$ would need to equal minus infinity. For continuous confounders this is of course not an issue. Maybe there exists a more efficient solution, but for now we will have to trim the taxa for which this occurs from further analysis in order to render the model identifiable. This trimming occurs already before fitting the independence model.

#### Implementation

For the filtering based on the prevalence and abundance, we need a confounder matrix

 1. Without intercept (Overall filtering has happened already)
 2. With __all__ levels of the categorical variables, so set $contrasts=FALSE$ to avoid hidden reference levels of the factors
 
 When actually filtering on the confounders, we can simply use a confounder matrix
 
 1. With intercept
 2. With treatment coding
 
 In this case all that matters is to change the offset formed by the independence model. We will still return the confoundes' parameters though.

### Zero-inflated poisson

We could also augment our model with a zero-inflated Poisson rather than a negative binomial distribution. This opens additional modeling perspectives. We can model the chance on a structural zeroes:

$$logit(P(X_{ij}=0)) = f + f_i + f_j + t_{i1}v_{j1}\chi_1 + t_{i2}v_{j2}\chi_2$$.

The probability of a strucutral zero does not depend on the sample: strucutural zeroes are assumed to be truly absent species and not due to undersampling. All samples come from the same population under $H_0$, and there the structural zeroes are only dependent on the columns. Therefor we set all $f_i=0$. In practice $f$ is not estimated either, instead $f_j$ is estimated without restrictions. The terms $t_{i1}v_{j1}\chi_1 + t_{i2}v_{j2}\chi_2$ indicate in which two independent directions the observed number of zeroes deviates from this base level. I think we need the term $f_i$ because otherwise the first dimension $t_{i1}$ scores will start correcting for it. The independence moel in this case is that the chance on a structural zero only depends on the marginal probabilities. A logit model without an intercept does not make sense, it assumes a baseline probability of structural zero of 0.5.

Fitting the mean part of this models encounters severe numerical problems, this part of the project is not retained and is put in the fridge.

#### Restrictions

The same restrictions apply to the scores $t_i$ and $v_j$ as to $r_i$ and $s_j$

#### Estimation (see Lambert 1992 for details)

The mean and zero probability are modelled independently, absence of a species is independent of its abundance when it is present. Say $Z=0$ when $X$ is from the Poisson state and $Z=1$ when X is a structural zero. Evidently, when $X=0$, Z is unknown.

EM algorithm: iterate between 

 - E: estimate Z, assuming  $\mathbf{r_i}$, $\mathbf{s_j}$ and $\mathbf{\Psi}$ known, through its expectation
 - M: Maximize the log-likelihood given Z
 
Unlike the RC(2)NB model, $f_j$ has to be estimated as well, there is no obvious candidate here. We estimate it marginally and then keep it fixed during the iterations. This way the score visualize departures in zero inflation from this independence of zero-inflation between rows and columns.

Newton-Raphson would be incredibly complicated here, the derivatives of the log-likelihood functions barely fit on a page!

## Constrained analysis

So far we have been doing unconstrained or unsupervised explorative visualization, or _indirect_ gradient analysis. We just visualized the strongest signals in the data, independent of sample covariates. Only then did we use the covariate information to try to correlate the covariates with the latent variables formed by the row and column scores. We usually do this by adding a colour code for the samples in our biplots.

A logical next step is to develop a __constrained__ method in the same framework, i.e. with the same error distribution. We argued that PCoA with Bray-Curtis distance or regular correspondence analysis did not perform well, and we expect the same for canonical correspondence analysis since it relies on the same distributional assumptions. We will visualize those departures from the independence model that can be explained by the sample covariates. Each dimension will thus consist of a linear combination of sample covariates, the weight of each of these covariates in the dimensions reflecting how much they contribute to explaining the variation. For background information see also Zhu _et al._ , 2005, and Zhang and Thas, 2012.

We call our n-by-d covariate matrix $C$, for every sample $i$, $d$ baseline covariates are measured. These covariates can be either discrete or continuous. $c_{iy}$ is the observed value of covariate $y$ in sample $i$, $\mathbf{c_{i.}}$ the whole covariate vector of length $d$ of sample $i$, and $\mathbf{c_{.y}}$ all recorded values of variable $y$.

### Constrained correspondence analysis (CCA)

In contrast to canoncical correlation analysis, constrained correspondence analysis (CCA) assumes bell-shaped response curves with respect to environmental variables. A __response curve__ describes the expeceted abundance of a species in function of an environmental score, which is a fucntion fo environmental variables. Canonical correlation analysis asssumes linear responses to the environmental variables, which is less useful in the ecological context. Classical ecological theory assumes species have an optimal combination of values of the environmental variables, and their expected abundances decrease as the environment departs from these optimal values.

Of course one could perform regular correspondence analysis, and then relate the obtained gradients to known envrionmental variables in a two-step approach. This is again an instance of _indirect_ gradient analysis (see Whittaker 1967).

Ter Braak (1987) proposes a method of direct gradient analysis based on CA: canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). It basically assumes that species have a Gaussian response curve in function of an environmental score which is a _linear_ conbination of environmental variables. The linear projection vector $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ is called the __environmental gradient__. The axes of the ordination are chosen in the light of the environmental variables. Prior to the analysis the environmental variables are centered and scaled to avoid arbitrariness in the choice of the units and render the elements of the envrionmental gradient comparable. The rows of the chi-square transformed matrix $R^{-1/2}(X-E)C^{-1/2}$ are subjected to weighted least squares regression on the environmental variables, with the sample totals as weights. The matrix of environmental variables undergoes weighted centering prior to model fitting. Then singular value decomposition is applied to the matrix of fitted values $F = U'\Sigma'V'$ of this regression. Using the fitted values assures that only the systematic part explained by the covariates plays a role. CCA is related to weighted Redundancy analysis (RDA) of the Chi-squared distances, just like regular CA is a PCoA of Chi-squared distances.

#### CCA triplots

In a triplot of a CCA ordination, the samples and species are plotted as points, and the elements of the environmental gradient as arrows. The species scores are the right singular vectors, the sample scores can be calculated as linear combinations of environmental variables (environmental scores), or as the weighted average of their species scores (weighted by species abundances). In the latter case, the closer the species points lie to to the sample point, the higher the expected abundance. The orthogonal projection of the species point onto the environmental arrow represents how much the expected abundance increases (decreases) with changes in this environmental variable.

#### Conditioning in CCA

Conditioning occurs in the same fashion as with regular CA: the residuals of the CCA on the conditioning matrix Z are the input for the CCA on the environmental variables of interest.

### Constrained RC(M) model

The following approaches to constrained analysis of ecological data exist, or have been considered

#### The classical approach for gradient analysis

This model comes from ecology and is the one used by Zhu _et al._ (2005) and Zhang and Thas (2012 and 2016). This assumes each taxon has an optimal combination of covariates, and its expected abundance decreases as the covariates depart from this optimal combination. The expected abundance follows a Gaussian distribution in function of this departure.

The expected counts are modelled as 

$$log(E(X_{ij})) = \sum_{k=1}^K \big(a_{jk} - \frac{(h_{ik} - q_{jk})^2}{2m_{jk}^2}\big)$$

whereby 

 - $h_{ik} = \boldsymbol{\alpha}_k^t \mathbf{c}_{i.}$ the optimal linear combination of $\mathbf{c}_{i.}$ in dimension $k$, also called the _environmental score_
 - $\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k$ is called the _environmental gradient_
 - $\alpha_{ky}$ is element corresponding to covariate $y$ of the environmental gradient in dimension $k$
 - $a_{jk}$ is the maximal logged expected abundance achieved when the linear combination of covariates $\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k^t \mathbf{c}_{i.}$ equals the optimum $q_{jk}$
 - $m_{jk}$ is the tolerance, it determines how fast the expected value decreases as $\mathbf{c}_{i.}$ moves away from its optimal values $\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k^{-t}h_{ik}$
 
 The scales of $h_{ik}$, $q_{jk}$ and $m_{jk}$ are undefined, so we need an additional restriction to render the model identifiable. Zhu _et al._, 2005 propose setting $\sum_{j=1}^p m_{jk}^2/p=1$. Note that $a_{jk}$, $q_{jk}$ and $m_{jk}$ are species specific parameters whereas $\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k$ is specific for the dimension but common to all species.
 
##### Triplot

- $q_{jk}$ is plotted as points as optimum per species
- The components of $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ are plotted as arrows for the environmental variables.
- The samples are plotted as their site scores $\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k^t \mathbf{c}_{i.}$
 
##### Estimation

The estimation iterates between estimating $\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k$ and $\boldsymbol{\beta}_{jk} = \big(a_{jk}, q_{jk}, m_{jk})$.

Note that this model is fitted without an intercept

<!---This model was designed with the ecological context in mind, whereby (continuous) environmental variables such as pH, temperature, sunlight intensity, ion concentrations, distance to landscape elements etc. were measured. However for microbiome data, we usually do not have direct measurements of variables in the ecosystem, but rather characterstics of the patient, which are very often categorical variables.

Let's take a look at the nature of the covariate data.

#```{r Nature of the covariates, eval=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
load("/home/stijn/PhD/American Gut/AGphylo.RData")
load("/home/stijn/PhD/Simulations/data/physeqList4Trim.RData")
load("/home/stijn/PhD/Simulations/data/zellerData.RData")
load("/home/stijn/PhD/Biplots/Kostic_data/phyloD.RData")
tableSamVar = function(x){
  table(sapply(sample_data(x), class))
}
phyList = list("American gut"=AGphylo, "Kostic"=phyloD, "HMP" = physeqList4Trim[["Throat"]], "zeller16S" = zellerSphy, "zellerMetagenomics" = zellerMphy)
sapply(phyList, tableSamVar)
#```

Most variables are factors or booleans. Below are the names of the variables shown:

#```{r covariate names, purl=FALSE}
sapply(phyList, sample_variables)
#```

I wonder how realistic the Gaussian response model still is with so many categorical variables and so many species. I guess we would best seek some expert advice of microbiome scientists.

#### RC(M) approach to gradient analysis

#### Constrained RC(M), overparametrized version

If we want to retain analogy with the unconstrained version and model only the departure from independence, we could fit the following model:

$$log(E(X_{ij})) = u + u_i + u_j  + \sum_{k=1}^K \psi_k s_{jk} f_{jk}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k^t \mathbf{c}_{i.}) $$

with $f_j$ the species-specific response function, which can be linear, quadratic (Gaussian on count scale), non-parametric, ... . The usual restrictions apply to the column scores $\mathbf{s}$:

$$\mathbf{s^tu_{tax}} = \mathbf{0}$$
$$\mathbf{s_k^tUs_{k'}} = I(k = k')$$

with $u_{tax}$ the vector of $exp(u_j)$'s and  $\mathbf{U}$ a diagonal p-by-p matrix with $u_{tax}$ on the diagonal.

For $\alpha$ (a d-by-k matrix) we enforce the following restrictions:

- Normalization restricts the size, and dimensions are orthogonal (if $k \geq 3$)

$$\boldsymbol{\alpha}^t\boldsymbol{\alpha} = \mathbb{1}_d$$

with $\mathbb{1}_d$ the identity matrix of dimension $d$.

However, this model is overparametrized: $s_{jk}$ and $f_{jk}$ both model the response of a taxon $j$ in the $k$-th dimension.

### Constrained RC(M), identifiable version

A more parsimonious version of this model can be obtained by dropping the column scores.

For any response function with $q$ parameters $\boldsymbol{\beta}_j$ we model the mean as:

$$log(E(X_{ij})) = log(\mu_{ij}) = u_i + u_j + \sum_{k=1}^K f_j \big( \boldsymbol{\alpha}_k^t \mathbf{C}_{i}|\boldsymbol{\beta}_j \big) .$$

Basically this represents a marriage of the RC(m) models of Goodman and the gradient models of Zhu and Hastie (2005). For the response function previously a quadratic function (Gaussian on count scale) has been proposed but this may not be realistic. Also the setting is different: we are looking for response function that maximize the __departure from independence__, no longer the abundances themselves! In a first stage we will try fit the linear model with $f(x) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x$ but later we might estimate $f$ non-parametrically as in Zhu _et al._ (2005). 

Note that the concept of a "row score" is lost here: since every taxon reacts differently to changes in the environment $C_{i.}$. Still this will not yield a perfect fit since $\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k^t$ is only unique to the dimension and the number of parameters $q$ estimated per response function $f_j$ is much smaller than the number of samples $n$.

Note also that this differs from the response function defined by Zhu and Hastie (2005): it no longer models mean abundance but mean departure from independence.

A linear response function may be most appropriate for problems with __short gradients__ i.e. whereby the difference in observed environmental variables is too short to devine more than an increase or decrease in departure from independence. Also in this case it is easy to interpret the effect of each of the environmental variables on the departure from independence. As so often in statistics, the linearity assumption may not be realistic, but renders models that are easy to interpret ("All models are wrong, but some models are useful"). For problems with __long gradients__, i.e. whereby species' departures of independence rise and drop (or drop and rise) within the score of the observed environmental scores, quadratic response functions may be more appropriate. This corresponds e.g. with the scenario whereby a species' abundance departs a lot from independence (e.g. by being very low) for extreme values of the environmental score, and behaves approximately like the independence model for an intermediate value of the environmental score. In essence this is the same as the approach of Zhu and Hastie, only now the baseline is the independence model rather than 0. Every taxon thereby has its own baseline, the response function models departures from this baseline. If the user is unsure and has enough data, he may use non-parametric response funcion. This may improve the sample and covariate ordination, although the result for the species becomes harder to interpret.

##### Relationship to constrained RC(M)

If we fit this method with only one covariate, namely a factor with a unique level for every sample, and all $\beta_{0j}=0$, we expect to find the same solution as the unconstrained case. This means we do not constrain the ordination at all in this case and $\beta_{1jk} = s_{jk}$ and $\alpha_{ik} = r_{ik}$.

#### Restricitions

##### Restrictions on the envrionmental gradient

The $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$'s of different dimensions will be constrained as follows:

$$\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k^t\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k = \mathbf{1}$$

$$\boldsymbol{\alpha_k}^t\boldsymbol{\alpha_{k'}} = 0$$

or in shorter notation

$$\boldsymbol{\alpha}^t \boldsymbol{\alpha} = \mathds{1}$$

One restriction I intended to include but which turns out to be a __very bad idea__ is to center the $\alpha$'s:

$$\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k^t\mathbf{1} = \mathbf{0}$$

This would force the parameter of a single continuous covariate to be 0, the parameters of two continuous variables to be each other's opposite. In short it is not very desirable and is not implemented.

##### Restrictions on parameters of categorical variables in the environmental gradient

For continuous variables the previous discussion suffises, but for categorical variables special attention is required. In a regular, unrestricted setting one would use treatment coding, setting one of the levels of the variable to be the reference level and estimate no parameter for it. However, the above normalization and orthogonality constraints render the result dependent on the choice of reference level, which is of course highly undesirable. Also for quick understanding of the biplot it would be convenient to plot all the values of the categorical variable, and save the reader the trouble of looking up the reference value. Because of these two reasons we will need a coding scheme that includes all parameters.

Say we have $d_{cont}$ continuous covariates and $d_{cat}$ categorical variables with $d = d_{cont} + d_{cat}$, and $m_l$ levels for every categorical variable $l$. Then $\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k$ compromises

$$ q = d_{cont} + \sum_{l=1}^{d_{cat}} (m_l-1) $$
rows, or $q$ parameters to be estimated. Note that there is no intercept needed in this case, intercepts have already be included in the $f()$ function, such that samples with $\alpha_k = \mathbf{0}$ can still have departures from independence.  We can write $\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k$ then as:

$$\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k = (\beta_{cont_1}, ... , \beta_{cont_{d_{cont}}}, \beta_{cat_{11}}, \beta_{cat_{12}}, ..., \beta_{cat_{1(m_1-1)}}, ...,  \beta_{cat_{d_{cat}(m_{d_{cat}}-1)}})_k$$
, i.e. one paramater less than the number of levels. For imposing the restrictions and for plotting we want a representation whereby all covariate levels are represented. We therefore include all parameters, and impose that the parameters sum to 0 within each covariate.

$$\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k' = (\beta_{cont_1}', ... , \beta_{cont_{d_{cont}}}', \beta_{cat_{11}}', \beta_{cat_{12}}', ..., \beta_{cat_{1m_1}}', ...,  \beta_{cat_{d_{cat}m_{d_{cat}}}}')_k$$
Whereby $q' = d_{cont} + \sum_{l=1}^{d_{cat}}(m_l)$, but under the restriction that for all categorical variables $l$

$$\sum_{m=1}^{m_l} \beta_{cat_{lm}k}' = 0$$ 

We again have $g$ degrees of freedom. It is this $\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k'$ that will need to be centered, normalized and orthogonalized _in order to treat each variable level equally_ and _avoid dependence of the outcome on the choice of reference level_. Also this representation will come in handy for plotting, centering the levels of the same covariate around zero. We will call this the __zero-sum__ representation.

##### Restricitions on the parameters of the parametric response functions

The parameters of the response functions are restricted as follows (for linear and quadratic response functions):

$$\boldsymbol{\beta}_1^t\boldsymbol{\beta}_1 = \boldsymbol{\beta}_0^t\boldsymbol{\beta}_0 = 1$$
and for quadratic response functions:

$$\boldsymbol{\beta}_2^t\boldsymbol{\beta}_2 = 1$$

Again, only the $\psi$ parameters can grow in size to reflect the importance of the dimension, other paramters are normalized.

Since $\lambda_j$ already represents the offset for taxon $j$, should we fit the response functions without offsets (all $\beta_{0j} = 0$)? This means that if the environmental scores equals zero, there is no departure from independence. However, this does not give species fully the chance to react in a different way to the environmental gradient. For a certain value, some species might depart from independence while others might not. Therefore we leave $\beta_{0j}$ to be freely estimated, under the variance 1 restriction.

#### Scaling

To render the values of the continuous variables in the environmental gradient comparable, it is clear that they need to be centered and scaled prior to model fitting, as in PCA. this means that their corresponding elements of $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ represent the contribution to the environmental score of one standard deviation away from the mean of this variable (in case of linear response functions). A perfect quantitative comparison to the magnitude of the values of the paramaters of the dummies of the categorical variables will never be possible. In our case, with 0-1 dummy coding, equal parameters for a dummy and a continuous variable imply that this level of the categorical variable contributes as much to the environmental score as one standard deviation away from the overall mean of the continuous variable (again in case of linear response functions).

#### Estimation of the constrained RC(M) model

##### Environmental gradient

$\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ could be estimated by ML as before, but in order to ensure maximum separation of the response functions of all the species we will consider a version of the log-likelihood ratio approach from Zhu _et al._ (2005):

$$LR(\boldsymbol{\alpha}) = log \frac{\prod_{i=1}^n \prod_{j=1}^p \big(p_j^{(\alpha)}(x_{ij};\boldsymbol{\alpha}^T \mathbf{c}_i,\boldsymbol{\beta}_j) \big)}{\prod_{i=1}^n \prod_{j=1}^p \big(p^{(\alpha)}(x_{ij};\boldsymbol{\alpha}^T \mathbf{c}_i,\boldsymbol{\beta}) \big)}$$

with $p^{(\alpha)}$ and $p^{(\alpha)}_j$ estimated probability density functions without and with taxon labels and $\boldsymbol{\beta}_l$ and $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ the parameters of the response functions. $p^{(\alpha)}$ and $p^{(\alpha)}_j$ are calculated under a certain error distribution (e.g. negative binomial). $LR(\boldsymbol{\alpha})$ actually compares two models. In the restricted model each species reacts in the same way to its environment, and all do not depart from independence for a certain combination of environmental variables. In the extended model each species is left to react to the environment in its own way

Naive approach

The naive approach to optimize $LR(\boldsymbol{\alpha})$ would be to use constrained optimization (constraining the $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$'s to have variance one etc.) and estimate $p_j^{(\boldsymbol{\alpha})}$ and $p^{(\boldsymbol{\alpha})}$ in every evaluation of this function. This implies a analytical jacobian cannot be estimated and requires a huge amount of re-estimation of the response functions. This naive approach is computationally unfeasible

Iterative approach

A smarter approach (also the one proposed by Zhu and Hastie, 2005) is to iterate between estimating $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ by optimizing $LR(\boldsymbol{\alpha})$ given $p_j^{(\boldsymbol{\alpha})}$ and $p^{(\boldsymbol{\alpha})}$, and estimating $p_j^{(\boldsymbol{\alpha})}$ and $p^{(\boldsymbol{\alpha})}$ given $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$. This results in much fewer estimations of $p_j^{(\alpha)}$ and $p^{(\alpha)}$ and allows to optimize $LR(\boldsymbol{\alpha})$ by finding the roots of $\frac{\partial LR(\boldsymbol{\alpha})}{\partial \boldsymbol{\alpha}} = \mathbf{0}$ (and analytically specifying the second order derivative).

Convergence is assumed when every single change in $\alpha$ is below a tolerance level (infinity norm), or when the L2-norm of alpha is below a tolerance level.

Estimating $p^{(\alpha)}_k$ non-parametrically in this iterative algorithm will be computationally more demanding.

<!---In case of linear response functions and the negative binomial error function, the likelihood ratio then equals (dropping the k-subscripts)

$$ LR(\boldsymbol{\alpha}| \boldsymbol{\beta}_{j}, \boldsymbol{\beta}) = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^p \psi s_{j}x_{ij} \Big(\mathbf{C}_i \boldsymbol{\alpha} (\beta_{1j} - \beta_{1}) + (\beta_{0j} - \beta_{0}) \Big)$$


--->

###### Lagrangian

Taking into account the restrictions mentioned above, the associated Lagrangian becomes

$$ Lag_{LR}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k| \boldsymbol{\beta}_{jk}, \boldsymbol{\beta}_{k}) =  \sum_{i=1}^n  \sum_{j=1}^p \Big(log \big(\frac{f_{NB}(x_{ij}|s_{kj}, \psi_k, \mathbf{C}_i, \boldsymbol{\alpha}_k, \phi_j, f_j)}{f_{NB}(x_{ij}|s_{kj}, \psi_k, \mathbf{C}_i, \boldsymbol{\alpha}_k, \phi_j, f_0)} \big) \Big) + \lambda_{1k} \boldsymbol{\alpha}_k^t\mathbf{M} + \lambda_{2k} (\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k^t \boldsymbol{\alpha}_k - 1) +  \boldsymbol{\alpha}_k^t \boldsymbol{\alpha}_{-k} \boldsymbol{\lambda}_{orth,k}$$

with $\boldsymbol{\alpha}_{-k}$ the $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$-matrix from the first to the (k-1)th column, and $f_{NB}$ the density function of the negative binomial distribution. $\boldsymbol{\lambda}_{orth,k}$ is a diagonal matrix with largangian multipliers for orthogonality on the diagonal.

###### Score equations

####### Linear response function

The first order derivatives becomes (in case of a linear response function, and remember we set $s_{jk} = 1$)

$$\frac{\partial Lag_{LR}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k)}{\partial \boldsymbol{\alpha}_k} = \psi_k \Big( \sum_{i=1}^n  \sum_{j=1}^p s_{jk} \mathbf{C}_i \beta_{1j} \frac{x_{ij} - \mu_{ij}}{1 + \frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j}} - \sum_{i=1}^n  \sum_{j=1}^ps_{jk} \mathbf{C}_i \beta_{1} \frac{x_{ij} - \mu_{ij0}}{1 + \frac{\mu_{ij0}}{\theta_j}} \Big) + \boldsymbol{\alpha}_k^t\mathbf{M}\boldsymbol{\lambda}_{1k} + 2\lambda_{2k} \boldsymbol{\alpha}_k +  \boldsymbol{\alpha}_{-k}^t \boldsymbol{\lambda}_{orth,k} = \mathbf{0}$$

with $\mu_{ij0}$ the mean under the null model of equal response functions and $\mathbf{M}$ a q-by-(q-$d_cont$+1) centering matrix. M has ones in the first column, the next columns are all zero except for the entries corresponding to the positons of the dummies of this categorical variable in $\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k$, which are 1. As such, M forces the coefficients of each categorical variable to sum to zero.  In theory we should perhaps reestimate $\theta_j$ on every iteration between the estimation of $\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k$ and $\boldsymbol{\beta}_j$ and $\boldsymbol{\beta}$, and also estimate different overdispersion for the models with equal and species-wise response function, but we think it will complicate the estimation and not make a big difference anyway, so we ignore this for now.

####### Quadratic response function

For a quadratic response function ($f_j(z_i = \mathbf{C}_i\boldsymbol{\alpha}|\boldsymbol{\beta}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 z_i + \beta_2 z_i^2$) this derivative becomes

$$\frac{\partial Lag_{LR}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k)}{\partial \boldsymbol{\alpha}_k} = \psi_k \Big( \sum_{i=1}^n  \sum_{j=1}^p s_{jk} \mathbf{C}_i (\beta_{1j}+2 \beta_{2j}\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k^t\mathbf{C}_i) \frac{x_{ij} - \mu_{ij}}{1 + \frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j}} - \sum_{i=1}^n  \sum_{j=1}^ps_{jk} \mathbf{C}_i (\beta_{1}+2 \beta_{2}\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k^t\mathbf{C}_i) \frac{x_{ij} - \mu_{ij0}}{1 + \frac{\mu_{ij0}}{\theta_j}} \Big) + \boldsymbol{\alpha}_k^t\mathbf{M}\boldsymbol{\lambda}_{1k} + 2\lambda_{2k} \boldsymbol{\alpha}_k + \boldsymbol{\alpha}_{-k}^t \boldsymbol{\lambda}_{orth,k} = \mathbf{0}$$

For a non-parametric density function this derivative is not available, which which greatly increase the optimization time.

The other derivatives are (independent of the shape of the response function):

$$\frac{\partial Lag_{LR}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k)}{\partial \boldsymbol{\lambda_{1k}}} = \boldsymbol{\alpha}_k^t \mathbf{M} = 0$$
$$\frac{\partial Lag_{LR}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k)}{\partial \lambda_{2k}} = \boldsymbol{\alpha}_k^t \boldsymbol{\alpha}_k - 1 = 0$$
$$\frac{\partial Lag_{LR}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k)}{\partial \lambda_{3k}} = \boldsymbol{\alpha}_k^t \boldsymbol{\alpha}_{-k} = 0$$

###### Jacobians

####### Linear response function

The second order derivatives are for the linear response function

$$\frac{\partial^2 Lag_{LR}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k)}{\partial \boldsymbol{\alpha}_k^2} = - {\psi_k}^2 \Big( \sum_{i=1}^n  \sum_{j=1}^p (s_{jk} \mathbf{C}_i \beta_{1j})^2 \frac{\mu_{ij}(1+ \frac{x_{ij}}{\theta_j})}{(1 + \frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j})^2} - \sum_{i=1}^n  \sum_{j=1}^p (s_{jk} \mathbf{C}_i \beta_{1})^2 \frac{\mu_{ij0}(1+ \frac{x_{ij}}{\theta_j})}{(1 + \frac{\mu_{ij0}}{\theta_j})^2} \Big) + 2\lambda_{2k} $$

$$\frac{\partial^2 Lag_{LR}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k)}{\partial {\alpha}_{yk}{\alpha}_{y'k}} = - {\psi_k}^2 \Big( \sum_{i=1}^n  \sum_{j=1}^p (s_{jk} \beta_{1j})^2 c_{iy} c_{iy'}\frac{\mu_{ij}(1+ \frac{x_{ij}}{\theta_j})}{(1 + \frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j})^2} - \sum_{i=1}^n  \sum_{j=1}^p (s_{jk} \beta_{1})^2 c_{iy} c_{iy'} \frac{\mu_{ij0}(1+ \frac{x_{ij}}{\theta_j})}{(1 + \frac{\mu_{ij0}}{\theta_j})^2} \Big) + 2\lambda_{2k} $$

####### Quadratic response function

For the quadratic response function these second order derivatives are:

$$\frac{\partial^2 Lag_{LR}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k)}{\partial \boldsymbol{\alpha}_k^2} = - {\psi_k} \Big( \sum_{i=1}^n  \sum_{j=1}^p \Big( (s_{jk} \mathbf{C}_i (\beta_{1j}+ 2\beta_{2j}\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k^t\mathbf{C}_i))^2 \frac{\mu_{ij}(1+ \frac{x_{ij}}{\theta_j})}{(1 + \frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j})^2}\psi_k + 2\beta_{2j}s_{jk} \mathbf{C}_i^2 \frac{x_{ij} - \mu_{ij}}{1 + \frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j}}\Big) \\- \psi_k\sum_{i=1}^n  \sum_{j=1}^p \Big( (s_{jk} \mathbf{C}_i (\beta_{1}+ 2\beta_{2}\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k^t\mathbf{C}_i))^2 \frac{\mu_{ij0}(1+ \frac{x_{ij0}}{\theta_j})}{(1 + \frac{\mu_{ij0}}{\theta_j})^2}\psi_k + 2\beta_{2}s_{jk} \mathbf{C}_i^2 \frac{x_{ij} - \mu_{ij0}}{1 + \frac{\mu_{ij0}}{\theta_j}}\Big) + 2\lambda_{2k} $$
$$\frac{\partial^2 Lag_{LR}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k)}{\partial {\alpha}_{yk}{\alpha}_{y'k}} = - {\psi_k}^2 \Big( \sum_{i=1}^n  \sum_{j=1}^p \Big( s_{jk}^2 (\beta_{1j} + 2\beta_{2j}\alpha_{yk}c_{iy})(\beta_{1j} + 2\beta_{2j}\alpha_{y'k}c_{iy'}) c_{iy} c_{iy'}\frac{\mu_{ij}(1+ \frac{x_{ij}}{\theta_j})}{(1 + \frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j})^2} + \\ 2\beta_{2j} c_{iy} c_{iy'}\frac{x_{ij} - \mu_{ij}}{1 + \frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j}} \Big) \\ 
- \sum_{i=1}^n  \sum_{j=1}^p \Big( s_{jk}^2 (\beta_{1} + 2\beta_{2}\alpha_{yk}c_{iy})(\beta_{1} + 2\beta_{2}\alpha_{y'k}c_{iy'}) c_{iy} c_{iy'}\frac{\mu_{ij}(1+ \frac{x_{ij}}{\theta_j})}{(1 + \frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j})^2} + \\ 2\beta_{2} c_{iy} c_{iy'}\frac{x_{ij} - \mu_{ij}}{1 + \frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j}} \Big) \Big) + 2\lambda_{2k} $$

The other derivatives are again independent of the response function:

$$\frac{\partial^2 Lag_{LR}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k)}{\partial \boldsymbol{\alpha}_k \partial \boldsymbol{\lambda_{1k}}} =  \mathbf{M}$$

$$\frac{\partial^2 Lag_{LR}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k)}{\partial \boldsymbol{\alpha}_k \partial \lambda_{2k}} =  2\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k$$

$$\frac{\partial^2 Lag_{LR}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k)}{\partial \boldsymbol{\alpha}_{k} \partial \boldsymbol{\lambda}_{orth,k}} =  \boldsymbol{\alpha}_{-k}$$
All other second order derivatives equal zero. 

###### Non-parametric response function

The response function $f(\boldsymbol{\alpha}^t\mathbf{C})$ need not have a parametric form. We can also estimate it non-parametrically as in Zhu and Hastie (2005). Like these authross, we use the locfit library. We regress $\frac{X}{exp(\lambda_i+\lambda_j)}$ on $\boldsymbol{\alpha}^t\mathbf{C}$ with a log-link. We limit the surface between this curve and the x-axis to sum to one as a means of normalization, only the importance parameter $\psi$ can differ in size between the different dimensions.

##### Estimation of parametric response functions

The score function for $\beta_{jv}$ under the negative binomial model with $v$ a parameter index running along $\boldsymbol{\beta}_j$ (for k=1 and omitting dimension indices)

$$ \frac{\partial l_{NB}(X_{.j}|\boldsymbol{\beta}_j, \theta_j)}{\partial \beta_{jv}} = \sum_{i=1}^n \psi s_j \frac{\partial f_j \big( \boldsymbol{\alpha}^t \mathbf{C}_{i.}|\boldsymbol{\beta}_j \big)}{\partial \beta_{jv}} \frac{x_{ij}-\mu_{ij}}{1+\frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j}}$$

In the linear case (when $f \big( \boldsymbol{\alpha}^t \mathbf{C}_{i.}|\boldsymbol{\beta}_j \big) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \boldsymbol{\alpha}^t \mathbf{C}_{i.}$) this becomes:

$$ \frac{\partial l_{NB}(X_{.j}|\boldsymbol{\beta}_j, \theta_j)}{\partial \beta_{j1}} = \sum_{i=1}^n \psi s_j \boldsymbol{\alpha}^t \mathbf{C}_{i.} \frac{x_{ij}-\mu_{ij}}{1+\frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j}}$$

The second order derivative in its general form is just horrible:

$$ \frac{\partial^2 l_{NB}(X_{.j}|\boldsymbol{\beta}_j, \theta_j)}{\partial \beta_{jv} \partial \beta_{jv'}} = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\psi s_j}{1+\frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j}} \Big( \frac{\partial^2 f_j \big( \boldsymbol{\alpha}^t \mathbf{C}_{i.}|\boldsymbol{\beta}_j \big)}{\partial \beta_{vj} \partial \beta_{v'j}} (x_{ij} - \mu_{ij}) + \frac{\partial f_j \big( \boldsymbol{\alpha}^t \mathbf{C}_{i.}|\boldsymbol{\beta}_j \big)}{\partial \beta_{vj}} \frac{\partial f_j \big( \boldsymbol{\alpha}^t \mathbf{C}_{i.}|\boldsymbol{\beta}_j \big)}{\partial \beta_{v'j}} \psi s_j \big(\frac{\mu_{ij}(1-\theta_j(1+\mu_{ij}))-x_{ij}}{\theta_j+\mu_{ij}} \big)  \Big)$$

In the linear case this simplifies to:

$$ \frac{\partial^2 l_{NB}(X_{.j}|\boldsymbol{\beta}_j, \theta_j)}{\partial \beta_{j1}^2 } = \sum_{i=1}^n - \frac{(\psi s_j \boldsymbol{\alpha}^t \mathbf{C}_{i.})^2 \mu_{ij} (1+ \frac{x_{ij}}{\theta_j})}{(1+\frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j})^2} $$

$$ \frac{\partial^2 l_{NB}(X_{.j}|\boldsymbol{\beta}_j, \theta_j)}{\partial \beta_{j1} \partial \beta_{j0} } = \sum_{i=1}^n - \frac{(\psi s_j \boldsymbol{\alpha}^t)^2 \mathbf{C}_{i.} \mu_{ij} (1+ \frac{x_{ij}}{\theta_j})}{(1+\frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j})^2} $$

$$ \frac{\partial^2 l_{NB}(X_{.j}|\boldsymbol{\beta}_j, \theta_j)}{\partial \beta_{j0}^2 } = \sum_{i=1}^n - \frac{(\psi s_j )^2 \mu_{ij} (1+ \frac{x_{ij}}{\theta_j})}{(1+\frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j})^2}$$

#### Algorithm

The whole estimation of the constrained RC(M)-model would then proceed as follows:

 1. Estimate the independence model ($u_i$'s, and $u_j$'s)
 2. (Optional): Filter out confounders by modifying offset
 3. Find starting values for $\alpha$, based on CCA
 4. Iterate between
  - Estimate $f_j$'s and $f_0$ given $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$
  - Find $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ by optimizing $LR(\boldsymbol{\alpha})$
 5. Estimate overdispersions using empirical Bayes
 6. Estimate importance parameter $\psi_k$
 7. Repeat steps 4-6 for every dimension $k$ until convergence

Filtering of rare taxa is not needed in this case, as all covariates are summarized in one "continuous" row score. to check for convergencen, for $\psi_k$  we apply an infinity norm, for $\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k$ the default is an L2-norm.

#### Triplot

The interpretation of the triplot is different from the one from Zhu _et al._ (2005), and also different from that of the unconstrained RC(M).

 - The components of $\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k$ are plotted as arrows and represent the extent to which the covariates contribute to environmental score in dimension $k$. Categorical variables are centered, all their levels are shown. The continuous variables have been centered and scaled, so the magnitude of their compponents in $\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k$ can be compared to one another.
 - For the samples, the environmental scores are plotted as points and represent environmental scores of each sample. Samples close together in one dimension come from similar environments, considering that environmental gradient.
 - The plot for the taxa depends on the response function used. 
    * In case of a linear response function we can plot arrows originating from $-\frac{\beta_{0j}}{\beta_{1j}}$, which represents the point of no departure from independence explained by the covariates. The direction and size of the arrow then depends purely on $\beta_{1j}\psi$. We can make two sorts of projections:
      - The projection of (-\frac{\beta_{0j}}{\beta_{1j}}, -\frac{\beta_{0j}}{\beta_{1j}} + $\beta_{1j}\psi$) onto $\boldsymbol{\alpha}^t\mathbf{C}_i$ (the environmental scores), then corresponds to the departure from independence for taxon $j$ in sample $i$ explained by its environmental variables $\mathbf{C}_i$. The arrow is appropriate since a larger environmental score always results in a larger departure from indepedence under this model. As often in statistics, linearity may not be a very credible assumption, but it leads to models that are easy to interpret.
      - The projection of (-\frac{\beta_{0j}}{\beta_{1j}}, -\frac{\beta_{0j}}{\beta_{1j}} + $\beta_{1j}\psi$) onto $(0,\alpha_y)$ reflects the sensitivity of taxon $j$ to changes in covariate $y$.
      We cannot make a direct connection between components of the environmental gradient $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ and the observed environmental scores $\boldsymbol{\alpha}^t\mathbf{C}_i$, even though this may seem so intuitively. Often it is so that a large $\alpha_y$ points in the direction of samples with a large $c_{iy}$, but this is not guaranteed. Many different combinations of covariates $\mathbf{C}_{i}$ can lead to the same environmental score for a given $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$. This is because of the dimension reduction from $d$ to 1 resulting from the projection by $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$. We will have to warn the user for this pitfall, and facilitate the depiction of the environmental variables of each samples trough colour codes.
    * In case of quadratic response function we should plot the extremum of the response functions in each dimension as a point (taking the importance parameter $\psi_k$ into account, which is multiplied by each of the parameters $\beta$ of the response functions). If this is a minimum, this represents the value of the environmental score with the smallest departure from indepence, in case of a maximum the largest departure. With colour and shape codes we can show which kind of extremum it is, and which kind of departure from indepedence (negative or positive effect on the expectation).
    * In case of non-parametric response function I do not see I clear way to plot the species. The benefit of this method will have to be the improved ordination of the environmental gradient and the samples. One can always look at the individual species response functions if one is interested.
  
It is clear that the triplot is not trivial to interpret, but then again: neither is a triplot based on CCA.

## Some general thoughts on the RC(M)

Contrary to most other methods to make biplots for microbiome data, the RC(M)-method is a truly statistical method that explicitly models the mean. This renders it very easy to interpret. It's main weaknesses are the reliance on a parametric distribution (which may be incorrect), and it's relatively long running times. However, many other biplot methods, such as CA ot PCoA with Hellinger distances, also make distributional assumptions, mostly without stating them explicitly.

#Likelihoods-------------------------------------
# A function to calculate the likelihoods of
#-The independence model
#-The saturated model
#-The fitted model
#-All models with dimension k 0<k<K
#Which overdispersions to use is a non-trivial problem.  One option would be to use the estimated dispersions of the full model for all calculations. Another is to estimate the overdispersions of the independence and lower dimensional models separately and use them. The problem is that if we use the edgeR machinery again, we get stable estimates but not MLE's, so that the likelihood of the independence model can sometimes be larger than that of a RC model. We provide three options, specified through the Disp parameter:

## Unconstrained RC(M)

### PCoA/MDS

Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) or multidimensional scaling (MDS) are dimension reduction techniques specifically for samples. The consist in calculating dissimilarity matrices with dissimilarities between samples based on some chosen dissimilarity measure. These dissimilarity matrices are than decomposed through eigenvalue decomposition, and the first two dimensions are plotted. More formally, for a n-by-p data matrix $\mathbf{X}$, all pairwise distances between samples $i$ and $i'$ $D_{ii'} = d(\mathbf{X_{i.}}, \mathbf{X_{i'.}})$ are calculated and summarized in a n-by-n dissimilarity matrix $\mathbf{D}$. If the dissimilarity measure is a true distance, then $d_{ii'} = d_{i'i}$ and $\mathbf{D}$ is symmetric. Next $\mathbf{D}$ undergoes eigendecomposition into

$$ \mathbf{D} = \mathbf{V}^t\boldsymbol{\Lambda}\mathbf{V} $$
  with the eigenvectors of $\mathbf{D}$ in the columns of $\mathbf{V}$ and $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$ a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues of $\mathbf{D}$ on the diagonal. $\mathbf{v}_1\lambda_1$ can then be plotted _vs_ $\mathbf{v}_2\lambda_2$ in a 2D scatterplot to represent distances between the samples optimally in 2D. In the calculation of $\mathbf{D}$, the information on the individual taxa is lost. Taxa scores can be calculated by weighted averaging of the sample scores for each taxon, weighted by the taxon abundances in these samples. The taxon score of taxon _j_ in dimension 1 then becomes
   
   $$t_{j1} = \sum_{i=1}^n v_{i1}*\frac{x_{ij}}{x_{.j}}$$
   
  This is a two step approach: the taxon scores are only calculated post-hoc and not as part of the eigendecomposition.
   
  In the following paragraphs we discuss a number of popular distance measures for microbiome data that are commonly used for PCoA.
   
#### Bray-Curtis dissimilarity

This distance measure was invented in 1957 in the context of forest ecology. It is calculated as

$$BC_{12} = 1-\frac{2*S_{12}}{S_1 + S_2}$$

with $S_{12}$ the counts or relative abundances of all species observed in \textbf{both samples}, and $S_{i}$ the counts or relative abundances of species only observed in sample $i$. This dissimilarity measure varies between 1 when no species are shared (maximal dissimilarity), and 0 when all species shared, and the community composition is identical. It is not a distance measure since it does not fulfill the triangle inequality $d(a,b) \leq d(a,c) + d(b,c)$. For use in microbiome research see e.g. Barfod _et al._, 2017 and many others.

#### Unifrac distance

The UniFrac distance was developed specifically for the microbiome by Lozupone and coworkers (2005), and includes phylogenetic information in the distance calculation. It is defined as the fraction of the phylogenetic tree lenght that leads to species found in only one of the two samples. As opposed to Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, it is a true distance metric.

##### Weighted Unifrac

To account for differences in sequencing depth, in 2007 weighted UniFrac was proposed. This weights every branch by the absolute difference in relative abundances the species of both samples as follows:

$$d_{UniFrac}(1,2) = \sum_{i=1}^b l_i |\frac{x_{1b}}{x_{1.}} - \frac{x_{2b}}{x_{2.}}|$$
with $x_{zb}$ the total abundance of species in sample _z_ pertaining to branch _b_. This means that also branches with species from both samples can contribute to the distance between the samples, if their compositions are uneven.

#### Jenssen-Shannon distance
   
We include the Jenssen-Shannon distance because of its role in the enterotypes publication (Arumugam _et al._, 2011). It is the square root of the Jenssen-Shannon _divergence_, a symmetrized version of the Kullback-Leibler divergence.

$$d_{Jenssen-Shannon}(a,b) = \sqrt{0.5 \sum_{j=1}^p x_{aj} log \frac{x_{aj}}{\frac{x_{aj}+x_{bj}}{2}} + 0.5 \sum_{j=1}^p x_{bj} log \frac{x_{bj}}{\frac{x_{aj}+x_{bj}}{2}}}$$

It is a true distance.

#### Hellinger distance

This came up during our own researhc into a version of correspondence analysis that would accurately model the variance of our count data. Still it is designed for distances between distributions rather than between real data ratios. It is defined as 

$$d_{hellinger}(a,b) = \sum_{j=1}^p (\sqrt{\frac{x_{aj}}{x_{a.}}}-\sqrt{\frac{x_{bj}}{x_{b.}}})^2 $$

. It does works on the relative abundances. It has been used in publications on microbiome, e.g. Kreisinger _et al._, 2015, Hollister _et al._ 2015, Vital _et al._, 2015.

#### Related material

   * See Warton _et al._ (2012): Distance-based multivariate analyses confound
location and dispersion effects
   * See technical report bio BioRankings: "Dealing with High-Dimensional Data". Pairwise distances all become similar in high dimensions.

### Correspondence analysis

This is the classical, statistical way of analysing contingency tables of count data. For discussion see the beginning of this document.

### CoDa

In recent years there have been many publications on analysing microbiome data as compositional. Gloor and Reid (2016) and Gloor _et al._ propose a method to extend this philosophy to biplots. In a frist step, zero counts are replaced by a non-zero pseudocount, either 0.5 or through a Bayesian method. Next the data are normalized to realtive abundances, divided by the geometric mean and log-transformed. This is called the central logratio transform (clr). PCA is applied to these transformed data (through eigendecomposition of the variance-covariance matrix) and sample scores mutliplied by eigenvalues are plotted. Row scores can be added as weighted sample means.

### Bayesian Nonparametric Ordination 

(Ren _et al._ (2016))
 
```{r CoDA}

 # Zeroes are fixed somehow
 # log-ratio transform of relative abundances
 # PCA on transformed values

CoDa = function(dat, abCutOff = 1e-6, scale = FALSE){
  require(zCompositions)
  classDat = class(dat) #The class provided
  
  ##The count data##
  if (classDat=="matrix"){

  X = if (taxa_are_rows(dat)) t(otu_table(dat)@.Data) else otu_table(dat)@.Data
  } else {stop("Please provide a matrix or a phyloseq object! \n")}
  
Xzero <- as.matrix(cmultRepl(X=X, method="CZM", output="counts")) #Correct zeroes in a Bayesian way

# convert to proportions 
Xnorm = Xzero/rowSums(Xzero)

#Trim on abundance in any sample
Xtrim = Xnorm[,apply(Xnorm,2,min)>abCutOff]

# make our compositional dataset
Xcrl <- apply(Xtrim, 1, function(x){log(x) - mean(log(x))})

# Apply PCA
prcomp(Xcrl, scale = scale) #Shouldn't this be scaled? It is not the default, and was not done by Gloor and Reid
}
```

```{r nonparametricBayesian}
# A bayesian approach, this is quite slow
#data(JRphylo) # A vaginal dataset
nonParamBayes = function(dat, hyper = list( nv = 3, a.er = 1, b.er = 0.3, a1 = 3, a2 = 4, m = 10, alpha = 10, beta = 0 )){

}
```
   
## Constrained

  - Constrained PCoA?
  - Constrained correspondence analysis (CCA)

# Method evaluation

After implementing the method and proving its concept, it is time to compare it with existing methodologies. We need to define a way to obtain datasets, and a way to evaluate the ordinations in a high-throughput way. For the simulation we will need multiple repetitions to prove the superiority of our method, so we need an automatic evaluation of the clustering accuracy.

## Within vs. overall distance

A first intuitive approach would be to compare the within cluster distances on the plot to the distances to the origin. Clusters are defined as samples generated with the same taxon distribution, either parametrically or non-parametrically. Say we have $m = 1,...,l$ groups with (multidimensional) means $\mathbf{M}_m$.  The within distance is then defined as $d_{m, within} = \frac{1}{n_m}\sum_{i=1}^{n_m} d_{euclidean}(\mathbf{M}_m, Y_i)$, with $d_{euclidean}$ the euclidean distance. The overall distance of a group then equals $d_{m, overall} = \frac{1}{n_m}\sum_{i=1}^{n_m} d_{euclidean}(\mathbf{0}, Y_i)$ with $\mathbf{0}$ the origin. This calculation can be done for each dimension separately or in the multidimensional space.

We could perhaps look for the distance based method that minimizes $\frac{d_{m, within}}{d_{m, overall}}$?

This approach can be applied to the row scores (samples) as well as the column scores (taxa).

```{r within vs. between distances}
# A function to calculate these within and overall distances
distanceFun = function(coord, clusters, Dim = c(1,2)){
  # @param coord: an nxk matrix of coordinates
  # @param clusters: a factor of length n with cluster memberships
  # @param Dim: The dimensions to look at, defaults to the first two
  
  # @return: a list with
    # -withinDist: within distances
    # -overalDist: the n overal distances
  
  coord = coord[,Dim, drop=FALSE]
  
  withinDist = tapply(seq_len(nrow(coord)), clusters, function(x){
    coordsX = coord[x,]
    centerX = colMeans(coordsX)
    dists = apply(coordsX, 1, function(y){
      dist(rbind(y, centerX))
    })
    return(dists)
  })
  
  overalCenter = colMeans(coord)
  overalDist = apply(coord, 1, function(y){
    dist(rbind(y, overalCenter))
  })
  
  ratio = mean(sapply(withinDist, function(x){x/overalDist}))
  list(withinDist = withinDist, overalDist =  overalDist, ratio = ratio)
  
}

See "Silhouettes: a Graphical Aid to the Interpretation and Validation of Cluster Analysis", Rousseeuw, 1987. The silhouette can be calculated with any distance measure, but we will just use the euclidean distance again. For each point $i$, calculate the distance to each other point in the ordination, and average these distances within the cluster. Call $a(i)$ the average distance to its own cluster and $b(i)$ the smallest of the average distances to the other cluster. The the silhouette of observation i $s(i)$ is defined as:

$$s(i) = \frac{a(i) - b(i)}{max\big(a(i), b(i)\big)}$$

The silhouette can take values between +1 for optimal separation and -1 for wrong classification. If a poin i close to the centroid of its own cluster but very far from all the others the methods has performed well and is rewarded with a high silhouette. We can average the silhouttes over the ordination or jus look at their distribution to compare the ordination methods.

```{r silhouette}
silhouette = function(coord, clusters, Dim = c(1,2)){
  # @param coord: an nxk matrix of coordinates
  # @param clusters: a factor of length n with cluster memberships
  # @param Dim: The dimensions to look at, defaults to the first two
 
  # @return a vector of n silhouettes
  
  coord = coord[,Dim, drop=FALSE]
  
  distMat = as.matrix(dist(coord)) # all distances
  avDists = apply(distMat, 1 , function(x){
    tapply(x[x!=0], clusters[x!=0], mean) #Exclude observation itself
  }) # Average distances with clusters
  ais = sapply(seq_along(clusters), function(i){
    avDists[clusters[i], i]
  }) #Average distance to own cluster
  bis = sapply(seq_along(clusters), function(i){
    min(avDists[clusters[i]!=levels(clusters), i])
  }) #Average distance to nearest cluster
  
  silhouette = mapply(ais, bis, FUN = function(a,b){(b-a)/max(a,b)}) #The silhouette
  
  return(silhouette)
}
```

## Correlation with library sizes and abundances

The motivating problem to develop the whole method was to find an approach that would not show correlation between the row scores and the library sizes, which is a technical artefact.

Pearson correlations of row scores with library sizes could be another criterion to evaluate the quality of the biplot. Equivalently correlations with average relative abundance can be investigated.

```{r libSizeCorrelation}
libCor = function(coord, margins, Dim = c(1,2)){
  apply(coord[, Dim, drop=FALSE], 2, cor, margins)
}
```

<!---
The between distance between groups m and m' is then defined as $d_{mm'} = d_{euclidean}(\mathbf{M}_m, \mathbf{M}_{m'})$ with $d_{euclidean}$ the euclidean distance.

## Contribution of taxa to the separation of the clusters

For the methods that do yield taxon scores, we can also verify if the correct taxa contribute to the separation of the clusters. A useful measure in this case seems the relative contribution of the taxa with signal in the direction of the cluster centroid. It is calculated as the ratio of the average contribution in the direction of the centroid of taxa with signal to all the average contribution of all other taxa. With $\mathbf{H}_l$ the vector from the origin to the centroid of group $l$, $\mathbf{s}_{l,sig}$ the $n_{l,sig}$-by-k matrix with scores of the $n_{l,sig}$ taxa in group l with signal and $\mathbf{s}_{l,noSig}$ the $n_{l,noSig}$-by-k matrix with scores of the $n_{l,noSig}$ taxa without signal, the quantity we are looking for is:

$$ \frac{n_{l,noSig} \mathbf{s}_{l,sig}\mathbf{H}_l \mathbb{1}}{n_{l,sig} \mathbf{s}_{l,noSig}\mathbf{H}_l \mathbb{1}}$$
with $\mathbb{1}$ a column matrix of one of the appropriate dimension. However, this will very often lead to negative and/or very large ratios. Therefore we look at the ratio of the signal taxa to the average signal of the 50\% non-signal taxa with highest signal.

```{r contrTaxa}
contrTaxa = function(rowMatPsi, colMat, groupFactor, idTax, sigFrac = 0.5, Dim = 1:3){
  rowMatPsi = rowMatPsi[,Dim]
  colMat = colMat[Dim,]
  centroids = matrix(unlist(tapply(seq_len(nrow(rowMatPsi)), groupFactor, function(i){
    colMeans(rowMatPsi[i,])
  })), nrow = ncol(rowMatPsi))
  colnames(centroids) = levels(groupFactor)
  contrib = sapply(seq_along(levels(groupFactor)), function(i){
        crossprod(colMat, centroids[, i])
  })
  sigContr = sapply(seq_along(levels(groupFactor)), function(i){
    mean(contrib[match(idTax[,i], colnames(colMat), nomatch = 0),i])
  })
  allContr = sapply(seq_along(levels(groupFactor)), function(i){
    mean(
      apply(contrib[!colnames(colMat) %in% idTax[,i],],2,sort, decreasing = TRUE)[round(seq_len(sigFrac*(nrow(colMat)-nrow(idTax)))), ])
  })
  ratios = sigContr/allContr
  ratios
}

# Simulations

## Unconstrained RC(M)

As ways of generating test datasets we see three different options

  1) Parametric simulation with the negative binomial with known abundances. 
  2) Non-parametric simulation with SimSeq
  3) Real datasets with biological signal allegedly known
  
  Parametric simulation is needed as a first check but evidently favours our method (if we use the negative binomial distribution). SimSeq is a reasonably neutral tool, we will only use WMW to obtain the lfdr. Real datasets will need to complement our analysis but it may not be possible to evaluate them in a high-throughput way, this will need to happen empirically.
  
### Parametric simulations

#### Negative binomial

The negative binomial is the assumed distribution of our method. As a result we should outperform all other methods in this setting.

\clearpage

##### Null setting

In this setting we simulate all distributions from the same template, thus there is no signal in this dataset

```{r NBnull, purl = FALSE}
p = 1000 #Number of taxa
n = 60 #Number of samples
nPop = 4 #Number of underlying populations

  if(!file.exists(file = "RCMsim/datList0.RData")){
datList0 = mclapply(mc.cores=1, 1:reps, function(i){
## Sample parameters
rhosSampled = sample(rhoEst, p)
thetasSampled = sample(thetaEst, p) #Sampled dispersions are the same in every population, this is the ideal case assumed by our method.
libSizesSampled = sample(libSizesEst, n) #Sampled libSizes

## Create dataset

plotCor(resList0Rows, datList0, scoreDim = "rows", dataMat =TRUE)
```

Hellinger distance, CoDa ana Bray-Curtis on absolut abundances show correlations with library sizes.

The taxa

```{r resList0cols sampleBiplot, purl = FALSE, include = FALSE}
#A sample biplot
resList0Cols = mapply(resList0, resList0Rows, FUN=extractCols, SIMPLIFY=FALSE)
randomScatter(resList0Cols)
# CA has outliers, CoDa and Hellinger reveal weird patterns
#randomScatter(resList0Cols, Dim = c(1,3))
```

```{r AbsCorr0, purl = FALSE, fig.cap = "Correlations of column scores with average relative abundances, results of 100 simulations shown for first two dimensions. Red diamonds indicate means.\\label{fig:libCor1}"}
plotCor(resList0Cols, datList = datList0,scoreDim = "columns", dataMat = TRUE)
rm(resList0Rows, resList0, datList0)
```

Only our RC(M) method has correlations at the level of random noise.

##### Simulate from different distributions

In this setting we will simulate data from 4 unrelated negative binomial distributions. Because of this clustering should be very good.

RCM comes out as best, CA as worst

plotCor(resList2Cols, datList2, dataMat = TRUE, scoreDim = "columns")
```

```{r taxRat2, purl = FALSE, fig.cap = "Mean ratio of signal taxa to top 50% non-signal taxa in terms of contribution to cluster separation, results of 100 simulations shown for first two dimensions for simulation with the negative binomial distribution with 10% DA taxa. Red diamonds indicate means. \\label{fig:taxRat2}"}
contr2 = mapply(resList2Rows, resList2Cols, IDlist2, FUN = contrTaxa, MoreArgs = list(groupFactor = groupFactor2))
```

The CoDa method is clearly affected by the library sizes, as is CA and Bray-Curtis on absolute abundances.

##### Negative binomial with phylogenetic information

In order to also include the very popular distance measures UniFrac and weighted Unifrac, we also generate data with the negative binomial and Dirichlet multinomial taking into account phylogenetic structure. We base our strategy on the second strategy described by Chen _et al._ ("Associating microbiome composition with environmental
covariates using generalized UniFrac distances", 2012). We generate random trees for the template vector of relative abundances, and modify abundances within one of the 20 clusters

```{r UniFrac, purl = FALSE}
p = 1000 #Number of taxa
n = 60 #Number of samples
nPop = 4 #Number of underlying populations
nPerPop = n/nPop #Number of samples per population
reps = 100 #replicates
nDim  = 3 #Number of dimensions
TPR = 0.1
FC = 5
k = round(1/TPR) #Number of clusters

groupInd = rep(1:nPop, each = nPerPop) #Group indicator, as integers
groupFactorPhy = factor(groupInd, levels = 1:nPop, labels =  paste("Population", 1:nPop), ordered = TRUE) #as factor

clusters = seq_len(k)

if(!file.exists(file = "RCMsim/resListPhy.RData")){

#### Other distributions

We also simulate datasets from other distributions than the negative binomial to see how the method behaves when its distributional assumptions are violated.

##### Zero-inflated negative binomial distribution

The zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) distribution was used by Zhang _et al._ (2016) for differential abundance testing. Our own goodness-of-fit tests indicate that for 14\% of the taxa, the ZINB provides a better fit than the regular NB

```{r simZINB, purl = FALSE, eval = FALSE}

##### Dirichelt-multinomial

The use of the Dirichlet multinomial for microbiome data was proposed by La Rosa _et al._ (2012). Although it is very restrictive in terms of variance and covariance structures, we include it here because of its relative popularity. Also Chen _et al._ (2012) use it to simulate data for a visualization.

```{r simDM, purl = FALSE}

Hellinger distance, CoDa ana Bray-Curtis on absolut abundances show correlations with library sizes.

The taxa

```{r resListDMcols sampleBiplot, purl = FALSE, include = FALSE}
#A sample biplot
resListDMCols = mapply(resListDM, resListDMRows, FUN=extractCols, SIMPLIFY=FALSE)
randomScatter(resListDMCols)
# CA has outliers, CoDa and Hellinger reveal weird patterns
#randomScatter(resListDMCols, Dim = c(1,3))
```

CoDa and Hellinger distances have unacceptable correlatios with the library sizes

```{r AbsCorrDM, purl = FALSE, fig.cap = "Correlations of column scores with average relative abundances, results of 1DMDM simulations shown for first two dimensions for simulation with the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution with 10% DA taxa. Red diamonds indicate means.\\label{fig:libCor1}"}

Red diamonds indicate means. A silhouette of 1 point to perfect classification, 0 to borderline cases, -1 to perfect wrong classification \\label{fig:silhouette1}"}
plotSil(resListDMRows, groupFactorDM)
```

JSD and Bray-Curtis have the best performance in this setting in terms of silhouette

```{r resListDMEvaldist, purl = FALSE, fig.cap = "Mean ratios of within to overal distance by method, results of 100 simulations shown for first two dimensions for simulation with the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution with 10% DA taxa. Red diamonds indicate means.  \\label{fig:dist1}"}
distRatioPlot(resListDMRows, groupFactorDM)
```

RCM comes out as best, together with JSD and Bray-Curtis

##### Nonparametric simulation

An objective simulation approach would be to use non-parametric resampling from a true dataset, as in _SimSeq_. For this we need microbiome datasets with covariates known to be related to bacterial abundance, preferably with more than two groups. The Zeller data is one such dataset, with the cancer variable expected to be related to relative abundance and having three levels (Normal, small adenoma and cancer). For the American Gut data we can use IBD. For the Turnbaugh lean and obese twins dataset we can use health status (lean, overweight or obese), even though we have only 18 samples. For the Turnbaugh humanized mouse dataset we could use "Diet", with levels "BK" and "Western".

We generate data as follows

1. Select a covariate and test for differential abundance using WMW/Kruskal-Wallis
2. Calculate local false discovery rates (lfdr)
3. Sample non DA taxa with equal weights from all taxa
4. Sample DA taxa from all taxa with weights equal to 1-lfdr
5. Sample counts from non DA taxa from samples with the most frequent covariate level
6. Sample counts from DA taxa from the samples with other covariate levels, and correct for differences in library sizes. This maintains the same distribution of covariate levels and overal daat matrix size as the original dataset. 

```{r simSeqFunctions}
# A wrapper function for phyloseq objects for the testing, yields the lfdr's of the taxa. We extend the original code to allow for Kruskal-Wallis test
testSimSeq = function(physeq, variable, filterTaxa = FALSE){

#### Some comments on analysing microbiome count data

##### Do not log-transform count data

- log-transforms come with arbitrary pseudocounts for the many zeroes
- models based on transformed data are hard to interpret in funcion of the untransformed data
- log-transformation does not stabilize the variance
- Accept non-normality and heteroscedasticity instead of trying to transform them away!
- Log-transformation is more robust though and provides better type I error control (see papers O'Hara 2010, Ives 2015, Warton 2016 and this [post](http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/114848/negative-binomial-glm-vs-log-transforming-for-count-data-increased-type-i-erro?rq=1) )

##### Do not rely on residuals-based approaches

- Most residual based approaches rely on normally behaved residuals
- Microbiome residuals are skewed to the right 
- The expectations should be larger than or equal to 5 for this approximation to hold, which is not the case for the majority of microbiome entries

##### Use a GLM

- Normalizing to relative or rarefied abundances throws away information on the variance and valuable counts
- Leave the data untransformed and use a proper GLM for counts! This will properly model mean and variance and allows incorporation of covariate information
