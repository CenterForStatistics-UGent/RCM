# Introduction

The aim of this notebook is to wrap the codes to fit the RC(M) model with the negative binomial, zero-inflated poisson and zero-inflated negative binomial models. Also an overview of the theory is given here.

The underlying motivation is to develop a visualization technique for the microbiome that does not suffer from the defects of currently applied techniques such as PCA, PCoA with Bray-Curtis distance etc. These methods are in particular sensitive to differences in library size.

# Theory

## Unconstrained analysis

### Correspondence analysis

Suppose we have a $nxp$ count data matrix $\mathbf{X}$ with $n$ samples and $p$ taxa, with $i$ and $j$ row respectively column indices.

#### Independence model

Under independence between rows and columns we model the counts in a contingency table as 

$$E(X_{ij}) = a_i b_j$$

whereby usually $a_i=x_{i.}=\sum_{j=1}^px_{ij}$ (the library sizes) and $b_j=\frac{x_{.j}}{x_{..}}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^nx_{ij}}{\sum_{j=1}^p\sum_{i=1}^nx_{ij}}$ (the average relative abundances).

#### Reconsitution formula of Correspondence Analysis (CA)

A more extended model is

$$E(X_{ij}) = a_i  b_j + c_i d_j \sum_{k=1}^K \omega_k v_{ki} w_{jk}$$.

For $a_i = c_i = x_{i.}$ and $b_j = d_j = \frac{x_{.j}}{x_{..}}$ this is regular correspondence analysis. The second term in the equation represents deviation from independence. This is called the *reconstitution formula* since it decomposes the observed average count into its expectation under independence and a residual. The residual is then further decomposed into $k$ pieces. The expected count can then be written as

$$E(X_{ij}) = \frac{x_{i.}x_{.j}}{x_{..}} \big(1 + \sum_{k=1}^K \omega_k v_{ki} w_{jk}\big)$$.

Regular corrsepondence analysis is done through singular value decomposition(SVD) of the matrix of weighted (Pearson) residuals

$$R^{-1/2}(X-E)C^{-1/2}=U\Sigma V$$

with $\Sigma$ a diagonal matrix and $R$ and $C$ diagonal matrices with row and column sums.

In matrix notation the reconstitution formula becomes

$$X = E_{independence} + R^{1/2}U\Sigma VC^{1/2}$$

with $\mathbf{1'}R^{1/2}U=\mathbf{0}$ and $\mathbf{1'}C^{1/2}V=\mathbf{0}$ (weighted means equal zero) and $U'R^{1/2}U=\mathbf{1}$ and $V'C^{1/2}V=\mathbf{1}$ (weighted variances equal one) (see VanDerHeijden et al., 1985).

For plotting usually $\omega_1 \mathbf{v_{1}}$ is plotted versus $\omega_2 \mathbf{v_{2}}$ to correctly represent the distances between the samples. $\mathbf{w_{1}}$ and $\mathbf{w_{2}}$ can then be added to construct a biplot. The orthogonal projection of $\omega_1 v_{ki}$ on $w_{jk}$ then represents the departure from the independence model of taxon $j$ in sample $i$ in dimension $k$.

#### Skewness

Because of the skewness of the distribution, the residuals are also very skewed. If we have an expectation of around 1, it is very likely to observe a zero, but much less likely to observe a 2. Still both deviations are weighted equally. I think a residual-based approach is ill suited to asymmetric, skewed data. Also the library size correction will never be appropriate, so that part of the biplot will reflect differences in library sizes. We considered decomposing

$$R^{-1}(X-E)C^{-1}$$

in the past to account for the fact that the data are not Poisson ($Var(X) = E(X)$) but rather negative binomial ($Var(X) = E(X) + \phi*E(X)^2$) and thus the variance for large means proportional to the squared expectation. Even more general we considered

$$R^{-a}(X-E)C^{-b}$$

and estimate $a$ and $b$ by maximum likelihood but we did not really see how to go on from here.

### Hellinger distance

With PCoA, any distance metric can be used to produce a distance matrix, which can be decomposed to make biplots.

The Hellinger distance divides by the square root of the observation as means of normalization:

$$\frac{X}{\sqrt{Var(X)}} \approx \frac{X}{\sqrt{X}} = \sqrt{X}$$

The rationale is that each observation x is the best estimate of its expectation E(X), and under the Poisson model also of its variance. Still also these plots are susceptible to differences in library sizes.

### Log-linear analysis

Another modelling approach is to use log-linear modelling an thereby introduce the negative binomial as error term. We know from previous goodness of fit testing that this is an appropriate error model for microbiome data.

In log-linear analysis the logged expected count $l_{ij}$ is modelled as

$$log(E(x_{ij})) = l_{ij} = u + u_i + u_j + u_{ij}$$.

For $u_{ij} \neq 0$ this is the saturated model, which provides a perfect fit by setting all expected values equal to the observed ones. If $u_{ij} = 0$ this is the independence model presented above.

### The RC(M)-association model

For the purpose of making biplots, we might consider the following model (proposed by Leo Goodman, 1985. See also VanDerHeijden 1994)

$$log(E(x_{ij})) = l_{ij} = u + u_i + u_j + \psi_1r_{1i}s_{1j} + \psi_2r_{2i}s_{2j}$$

or in matrix form:

$$\mathbf{lE} = \mathbf{u_{sam,MLE}}\mathbf{u_{tax,MLE}}^t + \mathbf{r}_k \mathbf{\psi}_k \mathbf{s}_k^t$$

with $\mathbf{lE}$ the n-by-p matrix of logged expectations, $\mathbf{u_{sam,MLE}}$ the vector with length $n$ with the row intercepts estimated by ML, $\mathbf{u_{tax,MLE}}$ the vector of length $p$ with the column intercepts estimated by ML, $\mathbf{r}_k$ the n-by-k matrix of row scores, $\mathbf{\psi}_k$ a diagonal matrix with the $k$ $\psi$'s on the diagonal and $\mathbf{s}_k$ the p-by-k matrix of column scores

Constraints are needed to render this model identifiable:

Centering:

$$\sum_{i=1}^nw_ir_{ki} = 0$$

with k=1,2 and

Normalization($k=k'$) and orthogonality ($k \neq k'$)

$$\sum_{i=1}^nw_ir_{ki}r_{k'i} = I(k=k')$$

$$\sum_{j=1}^pz_js_{kj} = 0$$

$$\sum_{j=1}^pz_js_{kj}s_{k'j} = I(k=k')$$
Hereby $w_i$ and $z_j$ are row and column weigths.

#### RC(M)-weights

The weights can be regarded as probability density functions, they represent the likelihood of sampling a certain sample or taxon from the population. On the population level we could say that

$$E(w_iX_{ik}) = 0$$,

i.e. the average row score on the population level is zero. This is a useful restriction to make sure that the biplot is centered around zero. Analogously we want that

$$E(w_iX_{ik}X_{ik'}) = I(k=k')$$

and accordingly for the column scores. But which weights $w_i$ and $z_j$ should we use?

Goodman proposes to use $w_i = x_{i.}$ and $z_j = x_{.j}$ thus uses _weighted_ constraints, to retain the relationship with correspondence analysis (see below). Becker _et al._ (1989) recommend using uniform weights not to let the marginal distribution affect the model fit. 

For the microbiome case, every subject comes from the same population under the null-hypothesis and all subjects are thus eqaully likely to be sampled and have the same importance. The library sizes as a purely technical artefact, unrelated to the biological importance of the subject. Consequently we use uniform row weights $w_i = 1/n$ (or $w_i = 1$, the magnitude is of no importance since the associated $\psi_k$ will grow or shrink accordingly). However, some taxa are more prevalent in the population than others. We want the average column scores on the population level to be centered around zero, have variance one and be orthogonal. That is why we set

$$E(z_j S_{jk}) = 0$$

$$E(z_j S_{jk} S_{jk'}) = I(k=k')$$

Because the more abundant species are in fact more abundant in the population as a whole (as opposed to samples with a large library size) it makes sense to use a marginal weighting scheme for the column scores. The weights $z_j$ will be estimated by maximum likelihood, as explained in the next paragraph.

#### RC(M) margins

The most logical choices for the margins have long seemed to use $u=-log(x_{..})$, $u_i = log(x_{i.})$ and $u_j = log(x_{.j})$.

However, the library sizes do not correspond to the maximum likelihood estimate of $u_i$ under the Negative Binomial model. As a result the first dimensional row scores $r_{1i}$ tried to correct for this effect and became related (linearly correlated) to the library sizes, which we want to avoid absolutley. To avoid this we set $u=0$ and estimate the $u_i$'s, $u_j$'s and overdispersions iteratively using maximum likelihood in a first step (this converges very quickly). The main disadvantage I see of this approach is that the independence model becomes model dependent. Next we'll have to iterate between fitting the overdispersions, the imporance parameters $\psi$, the $r's$ and the $s's$. 

The centering, normalization and orthogonality of the row and column scores is enforced through Lagrange multipliers. This makes the systems of equations much harder to solve but assures independence of the dimensions.

Note that this is a case of __indirect gradient__ analysis: the dimensions are estimated without incorporating gradient information (measured covariates) to maximally represent variability in the data. In a next step these obtained gradients can be compared with measured covariates (often graphically through a colour code) to see how well these covariates explain the gradients. 

#### Relationship between CA and log-linear analysis

According to Escoufier, 1985 if $a =\sum_{k=1}^K \omega_k v_{ki} w_{jk}$ is small (i.e. the deviation from independence is small) then $log(1+a) \approx a$ and

$$log(E(x_{ij})) = log(x_{i.}) + log(x_{.j}) - log(x_{..}) + log\big(1 + \sum_{k=1}^K \omega_k v_{ki} w_{jk}\big) \approx log(x_{i.}) + log(x_{.j}) - log(x_{..}) + \sum_{k=1}^K \omega_k v_{ki} w_{jk}$$

i.e. an equivalence between the RC(M)-model and correspondence analysis

Since the same restricitions apply to the scores $v_{ki}$ and $w_{jk}$ as to U and V, we can state that  $\psi_k \approx \omega_k$. The assumption that the departure from independence seems unlikely in our case, but it does provide us with some starting values.

### Fitting the RC(M) model

The models are usually fitted by ML. See page 55 of Goodman 1985 for details. Goodman assumed a Poisson distribution, but it might be possible to use a negative binomial model with unique dispersions for each taxon $j$ as well.

See Goodman 1985 (appendix), Becker 1988 for information on estimation. The code below is generic but we take k=2 for simplicity.

Parameters of interest to estimate are $\psi$, $r_1$, $r_2$, $c_1$, $c_2$. In the process we'll also need the nuisance parameters $\mathbf{\theta}$ and the offsets of the independence model $u_i$ and $u_j$. Assume $E(X_{ij}) = \mu_{ij}$ and  $Var(X_{ij})=\mu_{ij} + \frac{\mu_{ij}^2}{\theta}$

#### The negative binomial density function

For the sake of completeness we give the density function of the negative binomial distribution (see Lawless, 1987) in the ($\mu$, $\theta$) parametrization whereby $E(X_{ij}) = \mu_{ij}$ and $Var(X_{ij}) = \mu_{ij} + \frac{\mu_{ij}^2}{\theta_j}$ .

$$f_{NB}(X_{ij}) = \frac{\Gamma(X_{ij}+\theta_j)}{\Gamma(\theta_j)} \big(\frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j+\mu_{ij}}\big)^{X_{ij}} \big(\frac{\theta_j}{\theta_j+\mu_{ij}}\big)^{\theta_j}$$

#### Starting values

1. Obtain a singular value decomposition as $R^{-c}(X-E)C^{-d} = U\Sigma V$. This gives us initial values $[r_{11}^{init}, r_{12}^{init},..., r_{1i}^{init}] = U_{(1.)}$, the first row of $U$, and correspondingly $\Sigma$ and $V$ give initial values for $\mathbf{\psi}$ and $\mathbf{s}$. The values for $c$ and $d$ depend ont he weighting scheme used, e.g. if the sample weights are uniform ($w_i=1/n$) and the taxon weights marginal($z_j = x_{.j}$) then $c=1$ and $d=0$. This makes sure the initial centering conditions are fulfilled.

We still need to ensure that the (weighted) variances equal 1, so we set

$$r_{ki}^{init} = \big(\frac{w_ir_{ki}^{SVD}}{\sum_{i=1}^n{r^{SVD}_{ki}}^2w_i}\big)^{1/2}$$

and

$$s_{ik}^{init} = \big(\frac{z_js_{ik}^{SVD}}{\sum_{i=1}^n{s^{SVD}_{ik}}^2z_j}\big)^{1/2}$$

#### Iteration

2. If the independence model is estimated by MLE, estimate the $u_i$'s, $u_j$'s and $\theta_j$'s iteratively until convergence (set $u=0$). The estimating equeations are independent (Jacobian is diagonal) so this converges very quickly. Otherwise set $u_i = log(x_{i.})$ , $u_j = log(x_{.j})$ and $u = log(x_{..})$.

3. Estimate overdispersions

Theoretically we might estimate the dispersions by ML, but the estimates are very variable, which dramatically affects the rest of the fitting procedure.

 - Maximum likelihood estimation (not used) 
 
$$log(E(x_{ij})) = l_{ij} = offset\big(log(\frac{x_{i.}x_{.j}}{x_{..}}  \big) + \psi_1 (s_{1i}^{init}r_{1j}^{init}) + \psi_2 (s_{2i}^{init}r_{2j}^{init})\big)$$

to obtain estimates for the overdispersions $\theta_j$, whereby the means $\mu_{ij}$ are assumed known

 $$\sum_{i=1}^n \sum^{y_i^*}_{t=0} \big( \frac{t}{1+\frac{t}{\theta_j} } \big) + \theta_j^2 log(1+\frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j})- \mu_{ij}\frac{y_{ij}+\theta_j}{1+\frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j} }$$
 
 For this we can use the theta.ml() function in the _MASS_ package
 
 - edgeR robust
 
To get more stable estimates of the dispersions, RNA-seq packages such as _DESeq_ and _edgeR_ use an empirical Bayes approach to shrink dispersion estimates towards a fitted mean-dispersion trend. Here I use the machinery of edgeR robust (version `r packageVersion("edgeR")`) to estimate the dispersions
 
To reduce the computational cost and because the estimates do not change a lot anyway the estimation of the overdispersions is not repeated in every iteration

4. Estimate the psi parameters
 
 Solve the system of score equations (see Lawless 1987) for $\psi_1$ and $\psi_2$, assuming $\theta_j$'s given
 
 $$\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^p r_{im}s_{mj} \frac{y_{ij}-\mu_{ij}}{1+\frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j}} = 0$$ for all m=1,...,k
 
 with
 
 $$E(X_{ij}) = \mu_{ij} = exp\big(log(\frac{x_{i.}x{.j}}{x_{..}}) + \psi_1^{MLE} s_{1j}^{init}r_{1i}^{init} + \psi_2^{MLE} s_{2j}^{init}r_{2i}^{init} \big)$$.
 
 These are non-linear equations for which we use the _nleqslv_ package, with its default the Broyden method. This is a variation of the Newton-Raphson method (or Fisher scoring in case of ML) whereby the Jacobian is recycled and not recalculated at every iteration. The Jacobian is a square matrix of dimension k*(k-1)/2. The diagonal entry at position $kk'$ is:
 
 $$\frac{\delta^2 L_{NB}(\mu, \theta)}{\delta \psi_k \delta \psi_{k'}} = -\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^p r_{ik}r_{ik'}s_{kj}s_{k'j}\frac{\mu_{ij}(1+\frac{x_{ij}}{\theta_j})}{(1+\frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j})^2}$$
 
5. Estimate the row scores. 

To estimate the $r_{i}$'s we would like to use weighted least squares to minimize

$$\sum_{j=1}^p\Big(log(x_{ij}) - \big(u + u_i + u_j +\sum_{k=1}^M r_{ik} \big( \hat{\psi_ks_{jk}} \big)\Big)^2$$

for every $i$. Unfortunately we cannot calculate $log(x_{ij})$ because of the zeroes.

We'll have to use another way to estimate them, maximum likelihood in our case. I don't like using weighted least squares on the non-transformed counts,

$$\sum_{j=1}^p\Big(x_{ij} - exp\big(u + u_i + u_j +\sum_{k=1}^M r_{ik} \big( \hat{\psi_ks_{jk}} \big)\Big)^2,$$

because of the skewness of the residuals as explained above.

To enforce the constraints on the row scores one option would be to estimate all scores through full maximum likelihood and then modify a few of them to make them satisfy the constraints and repeat until convergence. This runs into numerical problems though, because the modified scores are usually very large initially which leads to overflow when exponenttiated. Instead we use the methods of the Lagrange multipliers to implement the constraints. We thus seek to maximize the Lagrangian function

$$Lag(r_{ik}, \mathbf{\lambda}) = L_{NB}(\mathbf{r}) + \sum_{k=1}^M \big( \lambda_{1k} \sum_{i=1}^n w_i r_{ik} \big) + \sum_{k=1}^M \big( \lambda_{2k} ( \sum_{i=1}^n w_i r_{ik}^2 ) - 1 \big) + \sum_{k \neq k'} \big(\lambda_{3kk'} \sum_{i=1}^n (w_ir_{ik}r_{ik'}) \big)$$

with $L_{NB}(\mathbf{r})$ the log-likelihood function of the negative binomial regression. The derivatives of this function for the following system of equations

$$\frac{\partial Lag(r_{ik}, \mathbf{\lambda})}{\partial r_{ik}} = \sum_{j=1}^p \hat{s}_{jk} \hat{\psi}_k \frac{y_{ij}-\mu_{ij}}{1+\frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j}} + \sum_{k=1}^M w_i \lambda_{1k}  + \sum_{k=1}^M \big(2 \lambda_{2k} w_ir_{ik}\big) +  \sum_{k' \neq k} w_ir_{ki} \lambda_{kk'} = 0$$

and 

$$\frac{\partial Lag(r_{ik}, \mathbf{\lambda})}{\partial \lambda_{1k}} = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i r_{ik} = 0$$

and 

$$\frac{\partial Lag(r_{ik}, \mathbf{\lambda})}{\partial \lambda_{2k}} = (\sum_{i=1}^n w_i r_{ik}^2) - 1 = 0$$

and 

$$\frac{\partial Lag(r_{ik}, \mathbf{\lambda}))}{\partial \lambda_{3kk'}} = (\sum_{i=1}^n w_i r_{ik}r_{ik'}) - 1 = 0$$

. The latter three groups of equations represent the original centering, normalization and orthogonality constraints. 

There are additional equations in the system now, but also as many extra $\lambda$ parameter to optimize. These $\lambda$ parameters are also stored and used as initial values in the next iteration run. There size represent the extent to which the constraints pull away the solution from the optimal, unconstrained solution, but I don't see how we can use that in a biologically or statistically meaningful way.

We now truly have a system of equations to solve, which we do with the _nleqslv_ package. It is straightforward but a bit cumbersome to also provide the analytical Jacobian, which greatly speeds up the iterations (otherwise it has to be approximated numerically). The Jacobian is sparse and symmetric. with following non-zero entries:

 $$\frac{\delta^2 Lag(\mu, \theta)}{ \delta r_{ik} \delta r_{ik'}} = -\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^p \psi_{k}\psi_{k'}s_{kj}s_{k'j}\frac{\mu_{ij}(1+\frac{x_{ij}}{\theta_j})}{(1+\frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j})^2}=0$$
 
  $$\frac{\delta^2 Lag(\mu, \theta)}{\delta r_{ik} \delta \lambda_{1k}} = w_i$$
  
  $$\frac{\delta^2 Lag(\mu, \theta)}{\delta r_{ik} \delta \lambda_{2k}} = 2w_ir_{ik}$$
  
  $$\frac{\delta^2 Lag(\mu, \theta)}{\delta r_{ik} \delta \lambda_{3kk'}} = w_ir_{ik'}$$
  
  All other entries are zero.
  
6. Estimate the column scores

Repeat step 4 but now estimate $s_{jk}$ column scores in the restrictions, e.g. the Lagrangian becomes:

$$Lag(s_{jk}, \mathbf{\lambda}) = L_{NB}(s_{jk}) + \sum_{k=1}^M \big( \lambda_{1k} \sum_{j=1}^p z_j s_{jk} \big) + \sum_{k=1}^M \big( \lambda_{2k}  ( \sum_{j=1}^p z_js_{jk}^2 ) - 1 \big) + \sum_{k \neq k'} \big(\lambda_{3kk'} \sum_{j=1}^p (z_js_{jk}s_{jk'}) - 1\big)$$

#### Termination

7. Repeat steps 3-6 until convergence. Convergence is assumed if between two iterations

 - None of the $\psi$ parameters change less than $0.01\%$ (infinity norm)
 
 AND
 
 - None of the square roots of the L2-norms of the relative changes of row and column scores exceeds 0.1%, or
 
 $$\forall \mathbf{r_k}, \mathbf{s_k} \Big(\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (1-\frac{r^{(iter-1)}_{ik}}{r^{(iter)}_{ik}})^2} < 0.001 \Big) \cup \Big( \sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^p (1-\frac{s^{(iter-1)}_{kj}}{s^{(iter)}_{kj}})^2} < 0.001 \Big)$$
 
 and analogously for all the scores. Other norms, such as L1 or infinity norms can also be used. A norm between 1 and 2 will lead to fast convergence.
 
 Overdispersions are not taken into account in determining the convergence since they're merely nuisance parameters.

#### Biplot

8. Plot $\psi_1r_{1i}$ vs $\psi_2r_{2i}$ and add $s_{1j}$ vs $s_{2j}$ as arrows to make a biplot. This makes sure the distnaces between the samples are represented correctly.

In the end we'll have estimated  p (abundances) + n (library sizes) + p (dispersions) + kxp (column scores) + kxn (row scores) + k (importance parameters) = (k+2)p + (k+1)xn + k parameters out of np entries. We have imposed 4k + k(k-1) restrictions, so the final model is still very parsimonious for n and p in the hundreds.

##### Model quality

9. Assess the goodness of fit

Since the model is overparametrized, classical ML theory (such as asymptotic behavious of maximum likelihood statistics) does not apply to our solution. Still we can compare the likelihoods of the independence, the RC(2) and the intermediate models to get an idea of the relative importance of the dimensions. The same concept exists for correspondence analysis, where the size of the diagonal elements of $\Sigma$ is proportional to the importance of the corresponding dimension. The log-likelihood of the saturated model is by definition equal to 0.

We can decompose the difference in log-likelihood between the independence and the full RC(K) model as

$$(LL_2 - LL_0) = (LL_1 - LL_0) + (LL_2 - LL_1)$$

with $LL_0$, $LL_1$ and $LL_2$ -2 the log-likelihoods of the independence, RC(1) and RC(2) models respectively. Scaling by $(LL_2 - LL_0)$ will provide interpretable fractions.

### One-by-one (1B1)

Initially all dimension were estimated jointly, but for reasons of speed we moved to a one-by-one approach estimating first the first dimension, then the second given the first, then the third given the first two and so on. By splitting the estimation procedures into smaller parts like this the estimation speeds up considerably, presumably because the systems are easier to solve.

### Confounders

Sometimes some covariates are known to affect the abundances but one is not interested in their effect. We think first and foremost of technical parameters such as sequencing center or technology. Thanks to our log-linear approach we can filter out the effect of these parameters by including interaction terms between the taxa and the confounding covariate to be filtered out. This willl occcur after fitting the independence model but before fitting the RC(M) component. We thus fit the following model in case of $c$ confounding variables:

 $$log(E(X_{ij})) = \lambda + \lambda_i + \lambda_j + \textcolor{red}{\sum_{l=1}^c \zeta_{jl}e_{il}} + \sum_{k=1}^M \psi_k r_{ik} s_{jk}$$
 
with $e_{il}$ the value of covariate $l$ in sample $i$ and $\zeta_{jl}$ the interaction parameter between taxon $j$ and confounding variable $l$. Note that we assume that the categorical variables have already been converted to multiple dummy variables.

#### Confounders and zero counts

Filtering out the effect of confounders brings the problems of the zeroes to the fore again. If a taxon has only zero counts in one of the subgroups defined by the confounding variables, the model will fail to fit again. For continuous confounders this is of course not an issue. Maybe there exists a more efficient solution, but for now we will have to trim the taxa for which this occurs from further analysis in order to render the model identifiable. This trimming best occurs already before fitting the independence model.

#### Implementation

For the filtering based on the prevalence and abundance, we need a confounder matrix

 1. Without intercept (Overall filtering has happened already)
 2. With __all__ levels of the categorical variables, so set $contrasts=FALSE$ to avoid hidden reference levels of the factors
 
 When actually filtering on the confounders, we can simply use a confounder matrix
 
 1. With intercept
 2. With treatment coding
 
 In this case all that matters is to change the offset formed by the independence model. We will still return the confoundes' parameters though.

### Zero-inflated poisson

We could also augment our model with a zero-inflated Poisson rather than a negative binomial distribution. This opens additional modeling perspectives. We can model the chance on a structural zeroes:

$$logit(P(X_{ij}=0)) = f + f_i + f_j + t_{i1}v_{j1}\chi_1 + t_{i2}v_{j2}\chi_2$$.

The probability of a strucutral zero does not depend on the sample: strucutural zeroes are assumed to be truly absent species and not due to undersampling. All samples come from the same population under $H_0$, and there the structural zeroes are only dependent on the columns. Therefor we set all $f_i=0$. In practice $f$ is not estimated either, instead $f_j$ is estimated without restrictions. The terms $t_{i1}v_{j1}\chi_1 + t_{i2}v_{j2}\chi_2$ indicate in which two independent directions the observed number of zeroes deviates from this base level. I think we need the term $f_i$ because otherwise the first dimension $t_{i1}$ scores will start correcting for it. The independence moel in this case is that the chance on a structural zero only depends on the marginal probabilities. A logit model without an intercept does not make sense, it assumes a baseline probability of structural zero of 0.5.

#### Restrictions

The same restrictions apply to the scores $t_i$ and $v_j$ as to $r_i$ and $s_j$

#### Estimation (see Lambert 1992 for details)

The mean and zero probability are modelled independently, absence of a species is independent of its abundance when it is present. Say $Z=0$ when $X$ is from the Poisson state and $Z=1$ when X is a structural zero. Evidently, when $X=0$, Z is unknown.

EM algorithm: iterate between 

 - E: estimate Z, assuming  $\mathbf{r_i}$, $\mathbf{s_j}$ and $\mathbf{\Psi}$ known, through its expectation
 - M: Maximize the log-likelihood given Z
 
Unlike the RC(2)NB model, $f_j$ has to be estimated as well, there is no obvious candidate here. We estimate it marginally and then keep it fixed during the iterations. This way the score visualize departures in zero inflation from this independence of zero-inflation between rows and columns.

Newton-Raphson would be incredibly complicated here, the derivatives of the log-likelihood functions barely fit on a page!

## Constrained analysis

So far we have been doing unconstrained or unsupervised explorative visualization, or _indirect_ gradient analysis. We just visualized the strongest signals in the data, independent of sample covariates. Only then did we use the covariate information to try to correlate the covariates with the latent variables formed by the row and column scores. We usually do this by adding a colour code for the samples in our biplots.

A logical next step is to develop a constrained method in the same framework, i.e. with the same error distribution. We argued that PCoA with Bray-Curtis distance or regular correspondence analysis did not perform well, and we expect the same for canonical correspondence analysis since it relies on the same distributional assumptions. We will visualize those departures from the independence model that can be explained by the sample covariates. Each dimension will thus consist of a linear combination of sample covariates, the weight of each of these covariates in the dimensions reflecting how much they contribute to explaining the variation. For background information see also Zhu _et al._ , 2005, and Zhang and Thas, 2012.

We call our n-by-d covariate matrix $C$, for every sample $i$, $d$ baseline covariates are measured. These covariates can be either discrete or continuous. $c_{iy}$ is the observed value of covariate $y$ in sample $i$, $\mathbf{c_{i.}}$ the whole covariate vector of length $d$ of sample $i$, and $\mathbf{c_{.y}}$ all recorded values of variable $y$.

### Constrained RC(M) model

I can see multiple possible modelling options

1) The classical approach

This model comes from ecology and is the one used by Zhu _et al._ (2005) and Zhang and Thas (2012 and 2016). This assumes each taxon has an optimal combination of covariates, and its expected abundance decreases as the covariates depart from this optimal combination. The expected abundance follows a Gaussian distribution in function of this departure.

The expected counts are modelled as 

$$log(E(X_{ij})) = \sum_{k=1}^K \big(a_{jk} - \frac{(h_{ik} - q_{jk})^2}{2m_{jk}^2}\big)$$

whereby 

 - $h_{ik} = \boldsymbol{\alpha}_k^t \mathbf{c}_{i.}$ the optimal linear combination of $\mathbf{c}_{i.}$ in dimension $k$
 - $\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k$ is called the _environmental gradient_
 - $\alpha_{ky}$ is element corresponding to covariate $y$ of the environmental gradient in dimension $k$
 - $a_{jk}$ is the maximal logged expected abundance achieved when the linear combination of covariates $\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k^t \mathbf{c}_{i.}$ equals the optimum $q_{jk}$
 - $m_{jk}$ is the tolerance, it determines how fast the expected value decreases as $\mathbf{c}_{i.}$ moves away from its optimal values $\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k^{-t}h_{ik}$
 
 The scales of $h_{ik}$, $q_{jk}$ and $m_{jk}$ are undefined, so we need an additional restriction to render the model identifiable. Zhu _et al._, 2005 propose setting $\sum_{j=1}^p m_{jk}^2/p=1$. Note that $a_{jk}$, $q_{jk}$ and $m_{jk}$ are species specific parameters whereas $\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k$ is specific for the dimension but common to all species.

The estimation iterates between estimating $\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k$ and $\boldsymbol{\beta}_{jk} = \big(a_{jk}, q_{jk}, m_{jk})$.

This model was designed with the ecological context in mind, whereby (continuous) environmental variables such as pH, temperature, sunlight intensity, ion concentrations, distance to landscape elements etc. were measured. However for microbiome data, we usually do not have direct measurements of variables in the ecosystem, but rather characterstics of the patient, which are very often categorical variables. Even for a continuous variable like age the Gaussian assumption seems weird to me. Keeping the other covariates fixed, this would mean there is an optimal age for bacteria to grow and their expected abundance would decrease for older or younger people. This may or may not be a realistic model.

Let's take a look at the nature of the covariate data.

```{r Nature of the covariates, eval=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
load("/home/stijn/PhD/American Gut/AGphylo.RData")
load("/home/stijn/PhD/Simulations/data/physeqList4Trim.RData")
load("/home/stijn/PhD/Simulations/data/zellerData.RData")
load("/home/stijn/PhD/Biplots/Kostic_data/phyloD.RData")
tableSamVar = function(x){
  table(sapply(sample_data(x), class))
}
phyList = list("American gut"=AGphylo, "Kostic"=phyloD, "HMP" = physeqList4Trim[["Throat"]], "zeller16S" = zellerSphy, "zellerMetagenomics" = zellerMphy)
sapply(phyList, tableSamVar)
```

Most variables are factors or booleans. Below are the names of the variables shown:

```{r covariate names, purl=FALSE}
sapply(phyList, sample_variables)
```

I wonder how realistic the Gaussian response model still is with so many categorical variables and so many species. I guess we would best seek some expert advice of microbiome scientists.

2) Classical approach: RC(M) variation

If we want to stay in the RC(M) framework we can also model the mean as:

$$log(E(X_{ij})) =  u + u_i + u_j  + \sum_{k=1}^K \big(a_{jk} - \frac{(h_{ik} - q_{jk})^2}{2m_{jk}^2}\big)$$

This approach differs from the one proposed in Zhu _et al._, 2005 in the intercepts $u_i$ and $u_j$. These intercepts will still be estimated by maximum likelihood in the first step, just as in the unconstrained case. We do not continue on this track.

3) Constrained RC(M)

A third option would be to drop the whole Gaussian assumption and build a model as follows:

$$log(E(X_{ij})) = u + u_i + u_j  + \sum_{k=1}^K \psi_k s_{jk} f_j(\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k^t \mathbf{c}_{i.}) $$

with $f_j$ the species-specific response function, which can be linear, quadratic (Gaussian on count scale), non-parametric, ... . The usual restrictions apply to the column scores $\mathbf{s}$:

$$\mathbf{s^tu_{tax}} = \mathbf{0}$$
$$\mathbf{s_k^tUs_{k'}} = I(k=k')$$

with $u_{tax}$ the vector of $exp(u_j)$'s and  $\mathbf{U}$ a diagonal p-by-p matrix with $u_{tax}$ on the diagonal.

For $\alpha$ (a d-by-k matrix) we enforce the following restrictions:

- Centering is desirable for the triplot (if $k \geq 2$)

$$\boldsymbol{\alpha}^t\mathbf{1} = \mathbf{0}$$
- Normalization restricts the size, only $\psi_k$ can grow in magnitude (if $k \geq 3$)

$$\boldsymbol{\alpha}^t\boldsymbol{\alpha} = \mathbb{1}_k$$

with $\mathbf{1}$ a vector of ones of length $d$ and $\mathbb{1}_k$ the identity matrix of dimension $k$.

### Response function

For the response function previously a Gaussian has been proposed but this may not be realistic. Also the setting is different: we are looking for response function that maximize the __departure from independence__, no longer the abundances themselves! In a first stage we will try fit the linear model with $f(x) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x$ but later we might estimate $f$ non-parametrically as in Zhu _et al._ (2005). For any response function with $q$ parameters $\boldsymbol{\beta}_j$ for every taxon $j$ the mean equals:

$$log(E(X_{ij})) = log(\mu_{ij}) = u_i + u_j + \sum_{k=1}^K \Big(\psi_k s_{jk} f_j \big( \boldsymbol{\alpha}_k^t \mathbf{C}_{i.}|\boldsymbol{\beta}_j \big) \Big).$$

Note that the concept of a "row score" is lost here: since every taxon reacts differently to changes in the environment $C_{i.}$. Still this will not yield a perfect fit since $\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k^t$ is only unique to the dimension and the number of parameters estimated per response function $f_j$ is much smaller than the number of samples $n$. In practice in R we will work with a row score matrix

#### Score equations

The score function for $\beta_{jv}$ under the negative binomial model with $v$ a parameter index running along $\boldsymbol{\beta}_j$ (for k=1 and omitting dimension indices)

$$ \frac{\partial l_{NB}(X_{.j}|\boldsymbol{\beta}_j, \theta_j)}{\partial \beta_{jv}} = \sum_{i=1}^n \psi s_j \frac{\partial f_j \big( \boldsymbol{\alpha}^t \mathbf{C}_{i.}|\boldsymbol{\beta}_j \big)}{\partial \beta_{jv}} \frac{x_{ij}-\mu_{ij}}{1+\frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j}}$$

In the linear case (when $f \big( \boldsymbol{\alpha}^t \mathbf{C}_{i.}|\boldsymbol{\beta}_j \big) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \boldsymbol{\alpha}^t \mathbf{C}_{i.}$) this becomes:

$$ \frac{\partial l_{NB}(X_{.j}|\boldsymbol{\beta}_j, \theta_j)}{\partial \beta_{j1}} = \sum_{i=1}^n \psi s_j \boldsymbol{\alpha}^t \mathbf{C}_{i.} \frac{x_{ij}-\mu_{ij}}{1+\frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j}}$$

The second order derivative in its general form is just horrible:

$$ \frac{\partial^2 l_{NB}(X_{.j}|\boldsymbol{\beta}_j, \theta_j)}{\partial \beta_{jv} \partial \beta_{jv'}} = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\psi s_j}{1+\frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j}} \Big( \frac{\partial^2 f_j \big( \boldsymbol{\alpha}^t \mathbf{C}_{i.}|\boldsymbol{\beta}_j \big)}{\partial \beta_{vj} \partial \beta_{v'j}} (x_{ij} - \mu_{ij}) + \frac{\partial f_j \big( \boldsymbol{\alpha}^t \mathbf{C}_{i.}|\boldsymbol{\beta}_j \big)}{\partial \beta_{vj}} \frac{\partial f_j \big( \boldsymbol{\alpha}^t \mathbf{C}_{i.}|\boldsymbol{\beta}_j \big)}{\partial \beta_{v'j}} \psi s_j \big(\frac{\mu_{ij}(1-\theta_j(1+\mu_{ij}))-x_{ij}}{\theta_j+\mu_{ij}} \big)  \Big)$$

In the linear case this simplifies to:

$$ \frac{\partial^2 l_{NB}(X_{.j}|\boldsymbol{\beta}_j, \theta_j)}{\partial \beta_{j1}^2 } = \sum_{i=1}^n - \frac{(\psi s_j \boldsymbol{\alpha}^t \mathbf{C}_{i.})^2 \mu_{ij} (1+ \frac{x_{ij}}{\theta_j})}{(1+\frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j})^2} $$

$$ \frac{\partial^2 l_{NB}(X_{.j}|\boldsymbol{\beta}_j, \theta_j)}{\partial \beta_{j1} \partial \beta_{j0} } = \sum_{i=1}^n - \frac{(\psi s_j \boldsymbol{\alpha}^t)^2 \mathbf{C}_{i.} \mu_{ij} (1+ \frac{x_{ij}}{\theta_j})}{(1+\frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j})^2} $$

$$ \frac{\partial^2 l_{NB}(X_{.j}|\boldsymbol{\beta}_j, \theta_j)}{\partial \beta_{j0}^2 } = \sum_{i=1}^n - \frac{(\psi s_j )^2 \mu_{ij} (1+ \frac{x_{ij}}{\theta_j})}{(1+\frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j})^2}$$

Except for the linear case, we will just calculate these numerically in practice, which is necessary anyway when $f$ is non-parametric.

### Constrained RC(M): Estimation

We would again first estimate the independence model ($u_i$ and $u_j$) as before, and then estimate one dimension at the time, conditional on the previous ones. If desirable, also the offset can be modified to eliminate some confounding variables. $\mathbf{\psi}$ and $\mathbf{s}$ will be estimated as before. $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ could be estimated by ML as before, but in order to ensure maximum separation of the response functions of all the species we will consider a version of the log-likelihood ratio approach from Zhu _et al._ (2005):

$$LR(\boldsymbol{\alpha}) = log \frac{\prod_{i=1}^n \prod_{j=1}^p \big(p_j^{(\alpha)}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}^T \mathbf{c}_i) \big)^{x_{ij}}}{\prod_{i=1}^n \prod_{j=1}^p \big(p^{(\alpha)}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}^T \mathbf{c}_i) \big)^{x_{ij}}}$$

with $p^{(\alpha)}$ and $p^{(\alpha)}_j$ estimated probability density functions without and with taxon labels. $p^{(\alpha)}$ and $p^{(\alpha)}_j$ are calculated as the expected counts under a certain error distribution (e.g. negative binomial) whereby $f_j()$ and $f_0()$ are estimated given $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ : 
$$p_j^{(\alpha)}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}^T \mathbf{c}_i) = e_{ij} = \exp\Big[u_i + u_j + \sum_{k=1}^K \Big(\psi_k s_{jk} f_j \big( \boldsymbol{\alpha}_k^t \mathbf{C}_{i.}|\boldsymbol{\beta}_j \big) \Big) \Big] $$ 
and 

$$p^{(\alpha)}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}^T \mathbf{c}_i) = e_{ij0} = \exp\Big[u_i + u_j + \sum_{k=1}^K \Big(\psi_k s_{jk} f \big( \boldsymbol{\alpha}_k^t \mathbf{C}_{i.}|\boldsymbol{\beta} \big) \Big) \Big] $$ 

(ignoring taxon labels when estimating $f()$).

The likelihood ratio then equals

$$LR(\boldsymbol{\alpha}) = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^p log(e_{ij})x_{ij}-\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^p log(e_{ij0})x_{ij}$$

$$LR(\boldsymbol{\alpha}) = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^p log(e_{ij})x_{ij}-\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^p log(e_{ij0})x_{ij}$$

Estimating $p^{(\alpha)}_k$ non-parametrically in this iterative algorithm may be computationally unfeasible.

### Estimating the environmental gradient

#### Naive approach

The naive approach to optimize $LR(\alpha)$ would be to use constrained optimization (constraining the $\alpha$'s to be zero-centered etc.) and estimate $p_j^{(\alpha)}$ and $p^{(\alpha)}$ in every evaluation of this function. This implies a analytical jacobian cannot be estimated and requires a huge amount of re-estimation of the response functions. This naive approach is computationally unfeasible

#### Iterative approach

A smarter approach is to iterate between estimating $\alpha$ by optimizing $LR(\alpha)$ given $p_j^{(\alpha)}$ and $p^{(\alpha)}$, and estimating $p_j^{(\alpha)}$ and $p^{(\alpha)}$ given $\alpha$. This results in much fewer estimations of $p_j^{(\alpha)}$ and $p^{(\alpha)}$ and allows to optimize $LR(\alpha)$ by finding the roots of $\frac{\partial LR(\alpha)}{\partial \alpha} = 0$ (and analytically specifying the second order derivative).

Convergence is assumed when every single change in $\alpha$ is below a tolerance level (infinity norm).

In case of linear response functions, the likelihood ratio then equals (dropping the k-subscripts)

$$ LR(\boldsymbol{\alpha}| \boldsymbol{\beta}_{j}, \boldsymbol{\beta}) = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^p \psi s_{j}x_{ij} \Big(\mathbf{C}_i \boldsymbol{\alpha} (\beta_{1j} - \beta_{1}) + (\beta_{0j} - \beta_{0}) \Big)$$

Taking into account the restrictions mentioned above, the associated Lagrangian becomes

$$ Lag_{LR}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k| \boldsymbol{\beta}_{jk}, \boldsymbol{\beta}_{k}) =  \psi_k \Big(\sum_{i=1}^n  \sum_{j=1}^p s_{j}x_{ij} \big(\mathbf{C}_i \boldsymbol{\alpha} (\beta_{1j} - \beta_{1}) + (\beta_{0j} - \beta_{0}) \big) \Big) + \lambda_{1k} \boldsymbol{\alpha}_k^t\mathbf{1} + \lambda_{2k} (\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k^t \boldsymbol{\alpha}_k - 1) + \boldsymbol{\lambda}_{orth,k} \boldsymbol{\alpha}_k^t \boldsymbol{\alpha}_{-k}$$

with $\boldsymbol{\alpha}_{-k}$ the $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$-matrix from the first to the (k-1)th column.

The first order derivatives become

$$\frac{\partial Lag_{LR}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k)}{\partial \boldsymbol{\alpha}_k} = \psi_k \Big( \sum_{i=1}^n  \sum_{j=1}^p s_{jk}x_{ij} \mathbf{C}_i (\beta_{1j} - \beta_{1}) \Big) + \lambda_{1k}\mathbf{1} + 2\lambda_{2k} \boldsymbol{\alpha}_k + \boldsymbol{\lambda}_{orth,k} \boldsymbol{\alpha}_{-k} = \mathbf{0}$$

$$\frac{\partial Lag_{LR}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k)}{\partial \lambda_{1k}} = \boldsymbol{\alpha}_k^t\mathbf{1} = 0$$
$$\frac{\partial Lag_{LR}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k)}{\partial \lambda_{2k}} = \boldsymbol{\alpha}_k^t \boldsymbol{\alpha}_k - 1 = 0$$
$$\frac{\partial Lag_{LR}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k)}{\partial \lambda_{3k}} = \boldsymbol{\alpha}_k^t \boldsymbol{\alpha}_{-k} = 0$$

The second order derivatives are

$$\frac{\partial^2 Lag_{LR}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k)}{\partial \boldsymbol{\alpha}_k^2} =  2\lambda_{2k} $$

$$\frac{\partial^2 Lag_{LR}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k)}{\partial \boldsymbol{\alpha}_k \partial \boldsymbol{\alpha}_{k'}} =  \boldsymbol{\lambda}_{orth,k}$$

$$\frac{\partial^2 Lag_{LR}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k)}{\partial \boldsymbol{\alpha}_k \partial \lambda_{1k}} =  1$$

$$\frac{\partial^2 Lag_{LR}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k)}{\partial \boldsymbol{\alpha}_k \partial \lambda_{2k}} =  2\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k$$

$$\frac{\partial^2 Lag_{LR}(\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k)}{\partial \boldsymbol{\alpha}_{k} \partial \boldsymbol{\lambda}_{orth,k}} =  \boldsymbol{\alpha}_{-k}$$
All other second order derivatives equal zero. 

#### Algorithm

The estimation would then proceed as follows:

 1. Estimate the independence model ($u_i$'s, and $u_j$'s)
 2. (Optional): Filter out confounders by modifying offset
 3. Find initial values for $\psi_k$ and $s_{jk}$ as before.
 4. Find starting values for $\alpha$ based on CCA
 5. Iterate between
  - Estimate $f_j$'s and $f_0$ and corresponding $e_{ij}$ and $e_{i.}$ given $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$
  - Find $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ by optimizing $LR(\boldsymbol{\alpha})$
  6. Estimate $\psi_k$ and $s_{jk}$ using ML and overdispersions using empirical Bayes
7. Repeat steps 4-6 until convergence

### Restricitions

The $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$'s of different dimensions will be constrained as follows:

$$\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k^t\mathbf{1} = \mathbf{0}$$

$$\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k^t\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k = \mathbf{1}$$

$$\boldsymbol{\alpha_k}^t\boldsymbol{\alpha_{k'}} = 0$$
#### Restricitons: Categorical variables

For continuous variables the previous discussion suffises, but for categorical variables special attention is required. For fitting the model we will use _treatment coding_ for simplicity. However, the above centering, normalization and orthogonality constraints should apply to all of the parameters, so using we will need a coding scheme that includes all parameters.

Say we have $d_{cont}$ continuous covariates and $d_{cat}$ categorical variables with $d = d_{cont} + d_{cat}$, and $m_l$ levels for every categorical variable $l$. Then $\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k$ compromises

$$ q = d_{cont} + \sum_{l=1}^{d_{cat}} (m_l-1) $$
rows, or $q$ parameters to be estimated. Note that there is no intercept needed in this case: This will be included in the $f()$ function.  We can write $\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k$ then as:

$$\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k = (\beta_{cont_1}, ... , \beta_{cont_{d_{cont}}}, \beta_{cat_{11}}, \beta_{cat_{12}}, ..., \beta_{cat_{1(m_1-1)}}, ...,  \beta_{cat_{d_{cat}(m_{d_{cat}}-1)}})_k$$
For imposing the restrictions and for plotting we want a representation whereby all covariate levels are represented so that the parameters sum to 0 within each covariate.

$$\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k' = (\beta_{cont_1}', ... , \beta_{cont_{d_{cont}}}', \beta_{cat_{11}}', \beta_{cat_{12}}', ..., \beta_{cat_{1m_1}}', ...,  \beta_{cat_{d_{cat}m_{d_{cat}}}}')_k$$
Whereby $q' = d_{cont} + \sum_{l=1}^{d_{cat}}(m_l)$, but under the restriction that for all categorical variables $l$

$$\sum_{m=1}^{m_l} \beta_{cat_{lm}k}' = 0$$ 

We again have $g$ degrees of freedom. It is this $\boldsymbol{\alpha}_k'$ that will need to be centered, normalized and orthogonalized _in order to treat each variable level equally_ and _avoid dependence of the outcome on the choice of reference level_. Also this representation will come in handy for plotting, centering the levels of the same covariate around zero. We will call this the __zero-sum__ representation. If we use a treatment coding approach, the reference levels will correspond with the centroid, which is harder to interpret I think, and I'm not sure if the normalization is still ok in that case. <!---For a single covariate we go from the treatment (with first level the reference level) to the zero sum representation by solving the following system:

$$\begin{pmatrix}
 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \ldots & 0 \\
 -1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & \ldots & 0\\
 0 & -1 & 1 & 0 &  \ldots & 0\\
 \vdots & \vdots &  \ddots & \ddots &  \vdots & \vdots\\
 0 & 0 &  \ldots & 0 &  -1 & 1\\
 1 & 1 & \ldots & 1 & 1 & 1\\
 \end{pmatrix} 
\begin{pmatrix}
\beta_1'\\
\beta_2'\\
\beta_3'\\
\beta_4'\\
\vdots \\
\beta_{m_l}'\\
\end{pmatrix} = 
 \begin{pmatrix}
 \beta_2\\
 \beta_3\\
 \beta_4\\
 \vdots \\
 \beta_{m_l}\\
 0
 \end{pmatrix}
 $$
For more parameters it suffises to append the system to the existing one, $\beta_0'$ is the only common term in all of them.
--->

Filtering of rare taxa is not needed in this case, as all covariates are summarized in one "continuous" row score.

### Triplot

The interpretation of the triplot is different from the one from Zhu _et al._ (2005), and also different from that of the unconstrained RC(M).

 - The components of $\alpha_k$ represent the extent to which the covariates contribute to the departure from independence in dimension $k$. Categorical variables are centered, all their levels are shown. For a scale-free solution, the continuous variables should be centered and scaled. Should the dummy variables not also be normalized then? QUESTION!
 - The samples represent the values of the product of the environmental gradient with their covariates. Samples close together in one dimension come from similar environments, considering that environmental gradient.
 - The taxa still represent the departure from independence of the taxa. They will be multiplied by the importance parameters $\psi$ in this case. A large score in a dimension means that the taxon departs from uniformity because of changes in the environmental conditions in this dimension. Taxa close together respond in a similar way to changes in environmental conditions. The sample-taxon distances and projections are meaningless in this case.

#Which overdispersions to use is a non-trivial problem.  One option would be to use the estimated dispersions of the full model for all calculations. Another is to estimate the overdispersions of the independence and lower dimensional models separately and use them. The problem is that if we use the edgeR machinery again, we get stable estimates but not MLE's, so that the likelihood of the independence model can sometimes be larger than that of a RC model. We provide three options, specified through the Disp parameter:
# - "MLE" Use the MLE's of the separate models where possible,
# - "edgeR" Use the edgeR robust estimate separately for every model

## Toy data

### Negative binomial

We generate some data as before with the NB distribution but differing library sizes, apply our algorithm and plot the results.

##### Plot the results

```{r Plot results no signal, purl=FALSE, include=FALSE}
solListNS = list("unifunif" = syntNBNSunifunif_3, "unifmarg" = syntNBNSunifmarg_3, "margunif" = syntNBNSmargunif_3, "margmarg" = syntNBNSmargmarg_3, "unifunifMLE" = syntNBNSunifunif_2MLE, "unifmargMLE" = syntNBNSunifmarg_2MLE, "margunifMLE" = syntNBNSmargunif_2MLE, "margmargMLE" = syntNBNSmargmarg_2MLE)# "unifmargunifRmarg" = test1,  "margmargunifRmarg"=test2, "margunifunifRmarg" = test3, "unifmargunifRunif" = test1unif, "margmargunifRunif"=test2unif, "margunifunifRunif" = test3unif,
#Runtimes and convergence
sapply(solListNS,function(x){x$converged})
sapply(solListNS,function(x){x$runtime})
```

###### Sample plots

Sample plots with the libsizes in colour. The first abbreviation refers to the weighting scheme for the rows(samples), the second to the weighting scheme for the columns. E.g "margunif" means $w_i = x_{i.}$ and $z_j = 1/p$. The "MLE"" epitheton indicates that the independence model was estimated by MLE. Note that in this design the library sizes are either $10^4$ or $10^5$.

```{r SamplePlotsNoSignal, results='hide', purl=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(2,4))
#unifmarg
lapply(names(solListNS), function(Y){with(solListNS[[Y]], {
  rMatPsi = rMat %*% diag(psis)
  dfCol = data.frame(Dim1=rMatPsi[,1], Dim2=rMatPsi[,2], col=rowSums(X))
  ggplot(data=dfCol, aes(x=Dim1, y=Dim2, col=col)) +geom_point(size=2) +ggtitle(Y) + scale_colour_continuous(name="Library sizes", low="red",high = "green")
    })
  })
```

There definitely is a trend: larger library sizes, larger dim1 scores. Plot the loadings as functions of the library sizes. 

Dimension 1

```{r loadings vs. library sizes dim1, results='hide', purl=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(2,4))
lapply(names(solListNS), function(Y){with(solListNS[[Y]], {plot(main=Y,rMat[,1] *psis[1] ,rowSums(X), ylab="Library sizes",xlab="Dim1", sub = paste0("Cor = ",round(cor(rMat[,1], rowSums(X)),2)) )})})
```

Dimension 2

```{r loadings vs. library sizes dim2, results='hide', purl = FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(2,4))
lapply(names(solListNS), function(Y){with(solListNS[[Y]], {plot(main=Y,rMat[,2] *psis[2],rowSums(X), ylab="Library sizes",xlab="Dim2", sub = paste0("Cor = ",round(cor(rMat[,2], rowSums(X)),2)) )})})
```

Dimension 3

```{r loadings vs. library sizes dim3, results='hide', purl = FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(2,4))
lapply(names(solListNS), function(Y){try(with(solListNS[[Y]], {plot(main=Y,rMat[,3] *psis[3],rowSums(X), ylab="Library sizes",xlab="Dim3", sub = paste0("Cor = ",round(cor(rMat[,3], rowSums(X)),2)))}))})
```

In all weighing schemes, the row scores of the first dimension increase with library size (not in absolute values but they form a gradient). This is likely a result of a discrepancy between the MLE estimates of the sequencing depths under the NB model and the library size (row sums of our count table $\sum_{j=1}^px_{ij}$, which are also just an _estimate_ of the sequencing depth, which does not account for different variances between species but treats them all equally).  The sum of NB-distributed variables is also approximately NB-distributed, although this is not mathematically guaranteed. The first dimension of the MLE row scores estimates then tries to correct for this aberration so that its effect disappears in the higher dimensions. We plot the estimates of the sequencing depths of the two different estimators

```{r plotSequencingDepthEstimators, purl = FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(1,1), pty="s")
with(solListNS[["unifunifMLE"]], {plot(rowSums(X),libSizesMLE, xlab ="Library sizes", ylab = "MLE sequencing depth",log="xy")})
abline(0,1);abline(h=c(1e4,1e5), col="red");abline(v=c(1e4,1e5), col="red")
MSElibs = mean((rowSums(solListNS[["unifunifMLE"]]$X)-rep(c(1e4,1e5), each=150))^2)
MSEmle = mean((solListNS[["unifunifMLE"]]$libSizesMLE-rep(c(1e4,1e5), each=150))^2)
```

There exist considerable differences between both estimation strategies, the MLE one seems less variable. Still the library sizes lead to the smallest MSE.

###### Taxon plots

Now let's take a look at the taxon plots

```{r NBNS taxon plots, results='hide', purl = FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(2,4))
lapply(names(solListNS), function(Y){with(solListNS[[Y]], {plot(main=Y,t(cMat), ylab="Dim2",xlab="Dim1")}) })
```

The taxon plots of the fits with uniform weights for the taxa are used ($z_j = 1/p$) suffer from outliers when the abundances are estimated as column sums. For the other weighting schemes it is hard to establish anay effect for now. Contrarily to my expectations it are the weights for the centering rather than the normalization requirement that cause the outliers. With MLE estimation of the abundances, the outliers are gone in all weighting schemes!

The taxon plot of second and third dimension

```{r taxonPlot2and3D, results='hide', purl = FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(2,4))
lapply(names(solListNS), function(Y){try(with(solListNS[[Y]], {plot(main=Y,t(cMat[2:3,]), xlab = "Dim2",ylab="Dim3")}))})
```

No more outliers in the higher dimensions

Are the taxon scores related to the abundances in any way?

```{r taxonScesvsAbunds1D, results='hide', purl = FALSE}
#Abundances
par(mfrow=c(2,4))
sapply(names(solListNS), function(Y){with(solListNS[[Y]], {plot(main=Y,abs(cMat[1,]), colSums(X), log="y", cex=0.5, ylab="Mean  abundances",xlab="abs(Dim1)", sub = paste0("Cor = ",round(cor(abs(cMat[1,]), log(colSums(X))),2)))})})
```

Marginal centering weights causes the column scores to slightly correlate with the abundances

```{r taxonScesvsAbunds23D, results='hide', purl = FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(2,4))
lapply(names(solListNS), function(Y){with(solListNS[[Y]], {plot(main=Y,abs(cMat[2,]), colSums(X), log="y", cex=0.5, ylab="Mean  abundances",xlab="abs(Dim2)", sub = paste0("Cor = ",round(cor(abs(cMat[2,]), log(colSums(X))),2)))})})
par(mfrow=c(2,4))
lapply(names(solListNS), function(Y){try(with(solListNS[[Y]], {plot(main=Y,cMat[3,], colSums(X), log="y", cex=0.5, ylab="Mean  abundances",xlab="abs(Dim3)", sub = paste0("Cor = ",round(cor(abs(cMat[3,]), log(colSums(X))),2)))}))})
```

No more problems in higher dimensions.

Do the taxon scores relate to the overdispersions?

```{r taxonScesvsthetas, results='hide', purl = FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(2,4))
lapply(names(solListNS), function(Y){with(solListNS[[Y]], {plot(main=Y, abs(cMat[1,]), thetas, log="y", cex=0.5, ylab="Overdispersion", xlab="abs(Dim1)", sub = paste0("Cor = ",round(cor(abs(cMat[1,]), log(thetas)),2)))})})
par(mfrow=c(2,4))
lapply(names(solListNS), function(Y){with(solListNS[[Y]], {plot(main=Y, cMat[2,], thetas, log="y", cex=0.5, ylab="Overdispersion", xlab="abs(Dim2)", sub = paste0("Cor = ",round(cor(abs(cMat[2,]), log(thetas)),2)))})})
```

Large overdispersions get larger scores in all dimensions. This need not be a problem, and may stand in relationship to abundances. Taxa ill fit by the NB may try to compensate this by a large OD and more extreme scores?

How do the MLE estimates for the mean abundances differ from the column sums?

```{r MLEvsColsums, results='hide', purl = FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
with(solListNS[["unifunifMLE"]], {plot(main="MLE abundances vs column sum abundances", colSums(X)/sum(X), abundsMLE, log="xy", cex=0.5, ylab="MLE abundances", xlab="Column sum abundance")})
abline(0,1)
```

There are subtle differences but less than with the library sizes. Why is the MLE less different from the marginal sum in this case? We can think of the following mathematical explanation: when calculating library sizes or abundances by row and column sums, each observations receives the same weight. However, when we estimate the margins through ML, we solve the following score equations:

$$\frac{\partial L(\mathbf{X}_i|\mathbf{u}_{i}, \mathbf{u}_j, \boldsymbol{\theta})}{\partial u_{i}} = \sum_{j=1}^p \frac{y_{ij}-\mu_{ij}}{1+\frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j}}$$

$$\frac{\partial L(\mathbf{X}_i|\mathbf{u}_{i}, \mathbf{u}_j, \boldsymbol{\theta})}{\partial u_{j}} = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{y_{ij}-\mu_{ij}}{1+\frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j}}.$$

Note that since we are estimating offsets the value of the regressor is 1. In this case the difference of $y_{ij}$ with the expected value $\mu_{ij}$ is weighted by a factor $\frac{1}{1+\frac{\mu_{ij}}{\theta_j}} = \frac{\theta_j}{\theta_j+\mu_{ij}}$. When estimating $u_j$, $\theta$ is a constant but when estimating $u_i$ it is different for every observation $y_{ij}$. Hence the weights put on every observation differ much more when estimating the sample offsets than when estimating the taxon offsets. That is the reason why the MLE differs more from the marginal sum for the library size than for the abundances.

##### Influence function

Take a look at the influence function values for the influence on the first psi parameters

```{r NS influence measures: psis, results="hide", purl = FALSE}
infl1 = lapply(solListNS, function(x, i){
  infl=with(x, NBpsiInfl(psi = psis[i], X = X, cMat = cMat[i,,drop=FALSE], rMat = rMat[,i, drop=FALSE], muMarg = outer(rowSums(X), colSums(X)/sum(X)), theta = thetas))
  id=abs(infl) > quantile( abs(infl),0.995)
  Xid = x$X[id]
  abunds = colSums(x$X)/sum(x$X)
  libsizes = rowSums(x$X)
  list(infl = infl, id = id, Xid = Xid, abunds=abunds, libsizes=libsizes)
},1)
# par(mfrow=c(3,5))
# lapply(names(infl1), function(x){
#   with(infl1[[x]], plot(abunds, colSums(id), log="x", main=x, ylab= "Number of influential observations"))
# })
par(mfrow=c(2,4))
lapply(names(infl1), function(x){
  with(infl1[[x]], plot(log(abs(c(t(infl))))~rep(cut(log(abunds),8),nrow(infl)), main=x, ylab = "log(|Influence|)",xlab = "log Abundance")) #Very heavy!
})
```

Larger abundances, larger influences in all weighting schemes (remember it is a log(abs())-plot).

Influence vs libSizes

```{r Influence vs libSizes, results="hide", purl = FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(2,4))
lapply(names(infl1), function(x){
  with(infl1[[x]], plot(log(abs(c(infl)))~rep(cut(log(libsizes),8),ncol(infl)), main=x, ylab = "log(|Influence|)",xlab = "log library size")) #Very heavy!
})
```

No clear trend of influence in function of the library sizes

How are the most influential observations as compared to the bulk of the observations?

```{r Influence vs non-influential observations, purl = FALSE}
lapply(names(infl1), function(x){
  with(infl1[[x]], {rbind(expectationsAll = quantile(outer(libsizes, abunds)),
       expectationsInfluentialObservation =quantile(outer(libsizes, abunds)[id])) })
})

# sapply(names(infl1), function(x){
#   rbind(zeroesAll = mean(solListNS[[x]]$X==0),
#        zeroesInfluentialObservation = mean(solListNS[[x]]$X[infl1[[x]]$Xid]==0)) })
```

The most influential observations are zero counts (or low counts) in highly abundant species and high libsizes (i.e. high expected values)!

Plot the influence vs. observed abundances

```{r X vs Infl(X), results="hide", purl = FALSE}
#Expectations
par(mfrow=c(2,4))
lapply(names(infl1), function(x){
  id = sample(1:prod(dim(solListNS[[x]]$X)), size=10000)
plot(log10(solListNS[[x]]$X+1)[id], infl1[[x]]$infl[id], ylab= "Influence", xlab = "log10(Counts +1)", main=x)
abline(v=0, col="red")
})
```

Versus expected abundances

```{r Infl vs observed abundances, results="hide", purl = FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(2,4))
lapply(names(infl1), function(x){
  id = sample(1:prod(dim(solListNS[[x]]$X)), size=10000)
plot(outer(rowSums(solListNS[[x]]$X), colSums(solListNS[[x]]$X)/sum(solListNS[[x]]$X))[id], infl1[[x]]$infl[id], ylab = "Influence", xlab = "Expected counts", main=x)
  abline(v=0, col="red")
})
```

Versus Raw residuals (Observed - Expected count)

```{r vs Pearson residuals, results = "hide", purl = FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(2,4))
lapply(names(infl1), function(x){
   id = sample(1:prod(dim(solListNS[[x]]$X)), size=10000) #Take a susbet for computability
plot((solListNS[[x]]$X-outer(rowSums(solListNS[[x]]$X), colSums(solListNS[[x]]$X)/sum(solListNS[[x]]$X)))[id], infl1[[x]]$infl[id], ylab = "Influence", xlab = "Raw residuals", main=x)#sqrt(diag(1/rowSums(solListNS[[x]]$X)))%*%%*%sqrt(diag(1/colSums(solListNS[[x]]$X)))
  abline(v=0, col="red")
})
```


```{r psi2Infl, eval=FALSE, purl = FALSE}
infl2 = lapply(solListNS, function(x, i){
  infl=with(x, NBpsiInfl(psi = psis[i], X = X, cMat = cMat[i,,drop=FALSE], rMat = rMat[,i, drop=FALSE], muMarg = outer(rowSums(X), colSums(X)/sum(X)), theta = thetas))
  id=abs(infl) > quantile( abs(infl),0.995)
  Xid = x$X[id]

},2)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
lapply(names(infl2), function(x){
  with(infl2[[x]], plot(abunds, colSums(id), log="x", main=x))
})
#In the second dimension, larger abundance means larger influence on the psis too, and no more outliers
lapply(names(infl2), function(x){
  with(infl2[[x]], plot(rep(abunds, nrow(infl)), c(t(infl)), log="x", main=x)) #Very heavy!
}) #Outlier in unifmarg weigthing scheme
lapply(names(infl2), function(x){
  with(infl2[[x]], plot(rep(libsizes, ncol(infl)), c(infl), log="x", main=x)) #Very heavy!
})
#Expectations
lapply(names(infl2), function(x){
  with(infl2[[x]], {rbind(quantile(outer(libsizes, abunds)),
       quantile(outer(libsizes, abunds)[id])) })
})
lapply(names(infl2), function(x){
  cat(x, "\n")
  with(infl2[[x]], table(Xid))
})
```

Under the uniform weighting scheme for the taxa, one single observation will get an enormous influence in the first dimension, this is in all likelihood the outlier. Note that we cen derive this from the influence function that does not even depend on the weights!

Influence on the colScores

```{r NBNS influence colscores, eval=FALSE, purl = FALSE}
inflCol1 = lapply(solListNS, function(x){
  try(with(x, NBcolInfl(X, psis, cMat, rMat,thetas , colWeights , k=1 , lambdaCol)))
})
#Only look at most extreme colscores
#Cannot calculate influence functions for the interesting cases (with the outliers)

```

```{r NBNS influence rowscores, eval=FALSE, purl = FALSE}
inflRowList1 = lapply(solListNS, function(x){
  try(with(x, NBrowInfl(X, psis, cMat, rMat,thetas , rowWeights , k=1 , lambdaRow)))
})
#Only look at most extreme colscores
#Cannot calculate influence functions for the interesting cases (with the outliers)
inflRowList1=inflRowList1[sapply(inflRowList1, class)=="list"]
#The influence on the first row score
inflRow1 = lapply(inflRowList1, function(x){getInflRow(x$score, x$InvJac, 1)}) 
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
libSizes = rowSums(solListNS[[1]]$X)
lapply(inflRow1, function(x){
  plot(y=x[,1], libSizes, log="x")
})
```

##### Conclusions from the null plots

 - No signal in either plot. 
 - For the uniform taxon weighting the first dimension of the plot is dominated by outliers
 - The first dimension row scores are related to the library sizes in all weighting schemes
 - The least abundant species get higher column scores in all weighting schemes
 
#### NB with signal

The signal is introduced by sampling from different distributions in which each time the abundance of a small set of species was modified.

# solListWSab = list("unifunif" = syntNBSigunifunif_ab, "unifmarg" = syntNBSigunifmarg_ab, "margunif" = syntNBSigmargunif_ab, "margmarg" = syntNBSigmargmarg_ab, "unifmargunifRmarg" = testAb1,  "margmargunifRmarg"=testAb2, "margunifunifRmarg" = testAb3, "unifmargunifRunif" = testAb1unif, "margmargunifRunif"=testAb2unif, "margunifunifRunif" = testAb3unif, "inverse"= testAbInv, "testEqualLibs" =   testAbLibs, "unifunifMLE" = syntNBSigunifunif_abMLE, "unifmargMLE" = syntNBSigunifmarg_abMLE, "margunifMLE" = syntNBSigmargunif_abMLE, "margmargMLE" = syntNBSigmargmarg_abMLE )

#Runtimes and convergence
sapply(solListWSab,function(x){x$converged})
sapply(solListWSab,function(x){x$runtime})
sapply(solListWSab,function(x){x$iter})
```

The first abbreviation refers to the weighting scheme for the rows(samples), the second to the weighting scheme for the columns. E.g "margunif" means $w_i = x_{i.}$ and $z_j = 1/p$. The MLE epitheton indicates that the independence model was estimated by MLE.

#### Sample plots

\newpage

```{r abSignalPlots, results='hide', fig.show="hold", fig.width = 12, fig.height = 9, purl = FALSE}
cols = c("grey", "red","blue","purple","green","brown","cyan","orange","black",  "magenta","yellow","pink", "darkblue","grey75","cadetblue") 
palette(cols)
par(mfrow=c(1,1), mar = c(4,4,4,4), mai=c(0,0,0,0))
lapply(names(solListWSab), function(Y){plotRCM(solListWSab[[Y]], samColour = sampleSigNBab, main=Y, biplot=FALSE, Dim = c(1,2), libInset=c(-0.1,0))})#, libLeg = Y ==names(solListWSab)[1]
```

##### 1st and 3rd dimensions

\newpage

```{r abSignalPlots23D, results='hide', fig.show="hold", fig.width = 12, fig.height = 9, purl = FALSE}
palette(cols)
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
lapply(names(solListWSab), function(Y){try(plotRCM(solListWSab[[Y]], samColour = sampleSigNBab, main=Y, biplot=FALSE, Dim = c(1,3), libInset=c(-0.8,0)))})
```

Only when the margins are estimated with MLE are the first two dimensions used to separate the signal well. Especially the uniform weighting for the samples and marginal for the columns (as was our first intuition) appears to perform well. Also uniform weighting for both yields good results.

#### Sample scores vs. libsizes

```{r abSignalPlots 13D, results='hide', fig.show="hold", purl = FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(2,4))
#Maybe a function of the library sizes
lapply(names(solListWSab), function(Y){with(solListWSab[[Y]], {
  rMatPsi = rMat %*% diag(psis)
  dfCol = data.frame(Dim1=rMatPsi[,1], Dim2=rMatPsi[,2], col=log(rowSums(X)))
  ggplot(data=dfCol, aes(x=Dim1, y=Dim2, col=col)) +geom_point(size=3) +ggtitle(Y) + scale_colour_continuous(name="Library sizes", low="red",high = "green")
    })
  })
```

Look at the scores' relationship to the library sizes more directly.

```{r ab libsizes, results='hide', fig.show="hold", eval=FALSE, purl = FALSE}
#Look at the loadings in function of the library sizes and abunds
par(pty = "m", mfrow = c(1,1), mar = c(5,4,4,4))
logP="x"
#Libsizes
lapply(names(solListWSab), function(Y){with(solListWSab[[Y]], {plot(main=Y,rMat[,1] *psis[1],x=rowSums(X), log=logP, xlab ="Dim1",ylab = "Library sizes", sub = paste0("Cor = ",round(cor(rMat[,1] ,rowSums(X)),2) ) )})})
lapply(names(solListWSab), function(Y){with(solListWSab[[Y]], {plot(main=Y,rMat[,2] *psis[2],x=rowSums(X), log=logP, xlab ="Dim2", ylab = "Library sizes", sub = paste0("Cor = ",round(cor(rMat[,2] ,rowSums(X)),2) ) )})})
# lapply(names(solListWSab), function(Y){try(with(solListWSab[[Y]], {plot(main=Y,rMat[,3] *psis[3],x=rowSums(X), log=logP, xlab ="Dim3", ylab = "Library sizes", sub = paste0("Cor = ",round(cor(rMat[,1] ,rowSums(X)),2) ) )}))})
```

On these plots it is clear that when the margins are estimated using the library sizes, the scores correlate with the library sizes.

In the MLE framework for the offsets, dependence on the library sizes has disappeared.

Compare MLE and rowSums estimators for the sequencing depth

```{r plotSequencingDepthEstimatorsAb, purl = FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(1,1), pty="s")
with(solListWSab[["unifunifMLE"]], {plot(rowSums(X),libSizesMLE, xlab ="Library sizes", ylab = "MLE sequencing depth",log="xy")})
 abline(0,1);#abline(h=c(1e4,1e5), col="red");abline(v=c(1e4,1e5), col="red")
# MSElibs = mean((rowSums(solListWSab[["unifunifMLE"]]$X)-rep(c(1e4,1e5), each=150))^2)
# MSEmle = mean((solListWSab[["unifunifMLE"]]$libSizesMLE-rep(c(1e4,1e5), each=150))^2)
```

The MLE estimate is generally larger than the rowSums estimate (presumably since the former puts less weight on zero counts (large overdispersion)), this may explain the gradient of the row scores in function of the library sizes.

##### Taxa plots

Now let's take a look at the taxon plots

```{r NBab taxon plots, results='hide', eval=FALSE, purl = FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(1,1), pty="s")
palette(cols)
lapply(names(solListWSab), function(Y){with(solListWSab[[Y]], {plot(main=Y,t(cMat), ylab="Dim2",xlab="Dim1", col = taxaSigNBab)}); legend("topright",legend = levels(taxaSigNBab), col=cols,pch= 1, cex=0.7, inset = c(-0.80,0), xpd=TRUE) })
```

For the uniform weighting of the samples we see outliers for the taxa

Are the taxon scores related to the abundances in any way?

```{r taxonScesvsAbunds1Dab, results='hide', eval=FALSE, purl = FALSE}
#Abundances
par(mfrow=c(1,1), mar=c(5,4,4,4))
sapply(names(solListWSab), function(Y){with(solListWSab[[Y]], {plot(main=Y,cMat[1,], colSums(X), log="y", cex=0.5, ylab="Mean  abundances",xlab="Dim1", sub = paste0("Cor = ", round(cor(cMat[1,], colSums(X)),2)))})})
```

The MLE offset estimation does reduce correlation with the mean abundances.

```{r taxonScesvsAbunds23Dab, results='hide', eval=FALSE, purl = FALSE}
# Second and third dimensions
par(mfrow=c(1,1), mar=c(5,4,4,4))
lapply(names(solListWSab), function(Y){with(solListWSab[[Y]], {plot(main=Y,cMat[2,], colSums(X), log="y", cex=0.5, ylab="Mean  abundances",xlab="Dim2", sub = paste0("Cor = ", round(cor(cMat[2,], colSums(X)),2)))})})
par(mfrow=c(1,1), mar=c(5,4,4,4))
lapply(names(solListWSab), function(Y){try(with(solListWSab[[Y]], {plot(main=Y,cMat[3,], colSums(X), log="y", cex=0.5, ylab="Mean  abundances",xlab="Dim3", sub = paste0("Cor = ", round(cor(cMat[3,], colSums(X)),2)))}))})
```

No more problems with correlation in higher dimensions.

Do the taxon scores relate to the overdispersions?

```{r taxonScesvsthetas1, results='hide', eval=FALSE, purl = FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
lapply(names(solListWSab), function(Y){with(solListWSab[[Y]], {plot(main=Y,abs(cMat[1,]), thetas, log="y", cex=0.5, ylab="Overdispersion", xlab="Dim1", sub = paste0("Cor = ", round(cor(abs(cMat[1,]), thetas),2)))})})
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
lapply(names(solListWSab), function(Y){with(solListWSab[[Y]], {plot(main=Y,cMat[2,], thetas, log="y", cex=0.5, ylab="Overdispersion", xlab="Dim2", sub = paste0("Cor = ", round(cor(abs(cMat[2,]), thetas),2)))})})
```

No real relationship with overdispersions

```{r lagrange multipliers, eval=FALSE, purl = FALSE}
##### Lagrange multipliers
par(mfrow=c(2,4))
lapply(names(solListWSab), function(Y){cat(Y, "\n");solListWSab[[Y]]$lambdaCol})
```

##### Biplots

First two dimensions

```{r ab biplots, results='hide', fig.show="hold", fig.width = 12, fig.height = 9, purl = FALSE}
#par(mfrow=c(2,4), mai = c(2,2,2,4))
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
palette(cols)
lapply(names(solListWSab), function(Y){plotRCM(solListWSab[[Y]], samColour = sampleSigNBab, main=Y, biplot=TRUE, Dim = c(1,2), taxColour=taxaSigNBab, taxLegPos = "bottomright", abundLeg=TRUE, taxCol  =cols, taxInset = c(-0.0,-0.0), libCex = 0.65, libInset = c(0.0,-0.0), arrowFrac = 0.05)})
```

Fisrt and third dimension

```{r ab23 biplots, results='hide', fig.show="hold", fig.width = 12, fig.height = 9, purl = FALSE}
#par(mfrow=c(2,4), mai = c(2,2,2,4))
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
palette(cols)
lapply(names(solListWSab), function(Y){plotRCM(solListWSab[[Y]], samColour = sampleSigNBab, main=Y, biplot=TRUE, Dim = c(1,3), taxColour=taxaSigNBab, taxLegPos = "bottomright", abundLeg=TRUE, taxCol  =cols, taxInset = c(-0,-0), libCex = 0.65, libInset = c(-0.0,-0.0), arrowFrac = 0.05)})
```

  with(infl2[[x]], table(Xid))
})
```

The most influential observations are zero counts in highly abundant species and high libsizes (i.e. high expectations)! Note that we cen derive this from the influence function that does not even depend on the weights!

Influence on the colScores

```{r Ab influence colscores, eval=FALSE, purl = FALSE}
inflColList1 = lapply(solListWSab, function(x){
  try(with(x, NBcolInfl(X, psis, cMat, rMat,thetas , colWeights = if(is.matrix(colWeights)) colWeights else{ cbind(colWeights, colWeights, colWeights)} , k=1 , lambdaCol)))
})
#Look at the signal from the first group
Id1 = which(taxaSigNBab=="Signal 1")[1]

inflCol1 = lapply(inflColList1, function(x){getInflCol(x$score, x$InvJac, Id1)}) 
lapply(inflCol1, function(x){
  boxplot(x[,Id1]~sampleSigNBab, las=2, ylab="Influence")
})
```

As expected, the samples with the signal have the highest impact on the score

```{r Ab influence rowscores Ab, eval=FALSE, purl = FALSE}
inflRowList1 = lapply(solListWSab, function(x){
  try(with(x, NBrowInfl(X, psis, cMat, rMat,thetas , rowWeights , k=1 , lambdaRow)))
})
#Only look at most extreme colscores
#Cannot calculate influence functions for the interesting cases (with the outliers)
inflRowList1=inflRowList1[sapply(inflRowList1, class)=="list"]
#The influence on the first row score
 
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
idRow = 10
libSizes = rowSums(solListWSab[[1]]$X)
inflRow1 = lapply(inflRowList1, function(x){getInflRow(x$score, x$InvJac, idRow)})
lapply(names(inflRow1), function(x){
  plot(y=inflRow1[[x]][,idRow], libSizes, log="x", main=x, col=(libSizes ==libSizes[idRow])+1, ylab="Influence")
})
```

Evidently, the observation from the sample itself has the largest influence. In the marginal weighting scheme for the libsizes, the larger libsizes sometimes get a larger influence, although the effect may be small.


```{r tolerances, eval=FALSE, purl = FALSE}
#Achieved tolerances
tolAchPsi = with(syntNBSigmargmarg_ab, lapply(1:k, function(y){sapply( 2:iter[y], function(x){abs(1-psiRec[y,x]/psiRec[y,x-1])})}))
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
lapply(tolAchPsi, function(x){plot(x, log="y");abline(h=0.01, col="red");abline(h=0.001, col="blue")})

with(syntNBSigmargmarg_ab,plot(psiRec[3,1:iter[3]])) #Weird jumps, don't stop too early!
```

#### A log-uniform approach

LU plots

```{r LU plots, include=FALSE, purl = FALSE}
load("toyDataSigLUserver.RData")
# solListWSLU = list("unifunif" = syntNBSigunifunif_LU, "unifmarg" = syntNBSigunifmarg_LU, "margunif" = syntNBSigmargunif_LU, "margmarg" = syntNBSigmargmarg_LU, "unifmargunifRmarg" = testLU1,  "margmargunifRmarg"=testLU2, "margunifunifRmarg" = testLU3, "unifmargunifRunif" = testLU1unif, "margmargunifRunif"=testLU2unif, "margunifunifRunif" = testLU3unif, "inverse"= testLUInv, "testEqualLibs" =   testLULibs, "unifunifMLE" = syntNBSigunifunif_LUMLE, "unifmargMLE" = syntNBSigunifmarg_LUMLE, "margunifMLE" = syntNBSigmargunif_LUMLE, "margmargMLE" = syntNBSigmargmarg_LUMLE )
names(sigListLU) = c("unifunif","unifunifMLE","margunif","margunifMLE","unifmarg","unifmargMLE","margmarg","margmargMLE")
solListWSLU = sigListLU

solListWSLU = solListWSLU[sapply(solListWSLU, class)=="list"] 
#Runtimes and convergence
sapply(solListWSLU,function(x){x$converged})
sapply(solListWSLU,function(x){x$runtime})
sapply(solListWSLU,function(x){x$iter})
```

The first Abreviation refers to the weighting scheme for the rows(samples), the second to the weighting scheme for the columns. E.g "margunif" means $w_i = x_{i.}$ and $z_j = 1/p$. The MLE epitheton indicates that the independence model was estimated by MLE.

##### Sample plots

```{r LUSignalPlots, eval=FALSE, purl = FALSE}
cols = c("grey", "red","blue","purple","green","brown","cyan","black", "orange", "magenta","yellow","pink", "olive","grey75","grey85") 
palette(cols)
par(mfrow=c(2,4))
lapply(names(solListWSLU), function(Y){plotRCM(solListWSLU[[Y]], samColour = sampleSigNBLU, main=Y, biplot=FALSE, Dim = c(1,2), libInset=c(-0.8,0))})
```

```{r LUSignalPlots23D, eval=FALSE, purl = FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(2,4))
lapply(names(solListWSLU), function(Y){try(plotRCM(solListWSLU[[Y]], samColour = sampleSigNBLU, main=Y, biplot=FALSE, Dim = c(1,3), libInset=c(-0.8,0)))})
```

Only when the margins are estimated with MLE are the first two dimensions used to separate the signal well. Especially the uniform weighting for the samples and marginal for the columns (as was our first intuition) appears to perform well. Also uniform weighting for both yields good results.

```{r LUSignalPlots 13D, eval=FALSE, purl = FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(2,4))
#Maybe a function of the library sizes
lapply(names(solListWSLU), function(Y){with(solListWSLU[[Y]], {
  rMatPsi = rMat %*% diag(psis)
  dfCol = data.frame(Dim1=rMatPsi[,1], Dim2=rMatPsi[,2], col=log(rowSums(X)))
  ggplot(data=dfCol, aes(x=Dim1, y=Dim2, col=col)) + geom_point(size=3) + ggtitle(Y)+ scale_colour_continuous(name = "Library sizes", low="red",high = "green")
    })
  })
```

On these plots it is clear that when the margins are estimated using the library sizes, the scores correlate with the library sizes.

Look at the scores' relationship to the library sizes more directly.

```{r LU libsizes, eval=FALSE, results = "hide", purl = FALSE}
#Look at the loadings in function of the library sizes and abunds
par(pty = "m", mfrow = c(2,4), mar=c(5,4,4,4))
logP="y"
#Libsizes
lapply(names(solListWSLU), function(Y){with(solListWSLU[[Y]], {plot(main=Y,rMat[,1] *psis[1],rowSums(X), log=logP, xlab ="Dim1", ylab = "Library sizes", sub = paste0("Cor = ", round(cor(rMat[,1], rowSums(X)),2)) )})})
lapply(names(solListWSLU), function(Y){with(solListWSLU[[Y]], {plot(main=Y,rMat[,2] *psis[2],rowSums(X), log=logP, xlab ="Dim2", ylab = "Library sizes" , sub = paste0("Cor = ", round(cor(rMat[,2], rowSums(X)),2)))})})
lapply(names(solListWSLU), function(Y){try(with(solListWSLU[[Y]], {plot(main=Y,rMat[,3] *psis[3],rowSums(X), log=logP, xlab ="Dim3", ylab = "Library sizes" , sub = paste0("Cor = ", round(cor(rMat[,3], rowSums(X)),2)))}))})
```

In the MLE framework for the offsets, dependence on the library sizes has disappeared

##### Taxa plots

Now let's take a look at the taxon plots

```{r NBLU taxon plots, results='hide', eval=FALSE, purl = FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(2,4))
lapply(names(solListWSLU), function(Y){with(solListWSLU[[Y]], {plot(main=Y,t(cMat), ylab="Dim2",xlab="Dim1", col = taxaSigNBLU)}); legend("topright",legend = levels(taxaSigNBLU), col=cols,pch= 1, cex=0.7, inset = c(-0.80,0), xpd=TRUE) })
```

For the uniform weighting of the samples we see outliers for the taxa

Are the taxon scores related to the abundances in any way?

```{r taxonScesvsabunds1DLU, results='hide', eval=FALSE, purl = FALSE}
#abundances
par(mfrow=c(2,4), mar=c(5,4,4,4))
sapply(names(solListWSLU), function(Y){with(solListWSLU[[Y]], {plot(main=Y,cMat[1,], colSums(X), log="y", cex=0.5, ylab="Mean  abundances",xlab="Dim1", sub = paste0("Cor = ", round(cor(cMat[1,], colSums(X)),2)))})})
```

The MLE offset estimation does reduce correlation with the mean abundances.

Second and third dimensions

```{r taxonScesvsabunds23DLU, results='hide', eval=FALSE, purl = FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(2,4), mar=c(5,4,4,4))
lapply(names(solListWSLU), function(Y){with(solListWSLU[[Y]], {plot(main=Y,cMat[2,], colSums(X), log="y", cex=0.5, ylab="Mean  abundances",xlab="Dim2", sub = paste0("Cor = ", round(cor(cMat[2,], colSums(X)),2)))})})
par(mfrow=c(2,4), mar=c(5,4,4,4))
lapply(names(solListWSLU), function(Y){try(with(solListWSLU[[Y]], {plot(main=Y,cMat[3,], colSums(X), log="y", cex=0.5, ylab="Mean  abundances",xlab="Dim3", sub = paste0("Cor = ", round(cor(cMat[3,], colSums(X)),2)))}))})
```

No more problems with correlation in higher dimensions.

Do the taxon scores relate to the overdispersions?

```{r taxonScesvsthetas2, results='hide', eval=FALSE, purl = FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(2,4))
lapply(names(solListWSLU), function(Y){with(solListWSLU[[Y]], {plot(main=Y,abs(cMat[1,]), thetas, log="y", cex=0.5, ylab="Overdispersion", xlab="Dim1", sub = paste0("Cor = ", round(cor(abs(cMat[1,]), thetas),2)))})})
par(mfrow=c(2,4))
lapply(names(solListWSLU), function(Y){with(solListWSLU[[Y]], {plot(main=Y,cMat[2,], thetas, log="y", cex=0.5, ylab="Overdispersion", xlab="Dim2", sub = paste0("Cor = ", round(cor(abs(cMat[2,]), thetas),2)))})})
```

No real relationship with overdispersions

```{r lagrange multiplierslu, eval=FALSE, purl = FALSE}
##### Lagrange multipliers
par(mfrow=c(2,4))
lapply(names(solListWSLU), function(Y){cat(Y, "\n");solListWSLU[[Y]]$lambdaCol})
```

##### Biplots

```{r LU biplots, results='hide', eval=FALSE, purl = FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(2,4), mai = c(2,2,2,4))
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
lapply(names(solListWSLU), function(Y){plotRCM(solListWSLU[[Y]], samColour = sampleSigNBLU, main=Y, biplot=TRUE, Dim = c(1,3), taxColour=tmp, taxLegPos = "bottomright", abundLeg=TRUE, taxCol  =cols, taxInset = c(-1.45,-0.75), libCex = 0.65, libInset = c(-0.85,0), arrowFrac = 0.05)})
```

##### Influence function

Take a look at the influence function values on the psis

```{r LU influence measures: psis, eval=FALSE, purl = FALSE}
infl1 = lapply(solListWSLU, function(x, i){ 
  infl=with(x, NBpsiInfl(psi = psis[i], X = X, cMat = cMat[i,,drop=FALSE], rMat = rMat[,i, drop=FALSE], muMarg = outer(rowSums(X), colSums(X)/sum(X)), theta = thetas))
  id=LUs(infl) > quantile( LUs(infl),0.995)
  Xid = x$X[id]
  abunds = colSums(x$X)/sum(x$X)
  libsizes = rowSums(x$X)
  list(infl = infl, id = id, Xid = Xid, abunds=abunds, libsizes=libsizes)
},1)
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
lapply(names(infl1), function(x){
  with(infl1[[x]], plot(abunds, colSums(id), log="x", main=x, ylab="Number of very influential observations"))
}) #High abundances, larger influence
lapply(names(infl1), function(x){
  idTmp = sample(seq_along(infl1[[x]]$abunds), 200) #For speed
  with(infl1[[x]], plot(rep(abunds[idTmp], nrow(infl)), c(t(infl[,idTmp])), log="x", main=x, xlab="abundance",ylab = "Influence")) #Very heavy!
})
lapply(names(infl1), function(x){
  idTmp = sample(seq_along(infl1[[x]]$libsizes), 200) #For speed

})
#Expectations
lapply(names(infl1), function(x){
  with(infl1[[x]], {rbind(quantile(outer(libsizes, abunds)),
       quantile(outer(libsizes, abunds)[id])) })
}) #Influential observations have high expectations
lapply(names(infl1), function(x){
  cat(x, "\n")
  with(infl1[[x]], table(Xid))
}) # ... but are very often zero!

infl2 = lapply(solListWSLU, function(x, i){
  infl=with(x, NBpsiInfl(psi = psis[i], X = X, cMat = cMat[i,,drop=FALSE], rMat = rMat[,i, drop=FALSE], muMarg = outer(rowSums(X), colSums(X)/sum(X)), theta = thetas))
  id=LUs(infl) > quantile( LUs(infl),0.995)
  Xid = x$X[id]
  abunds = colSums(x$X)/sum(x$X)
  libsizes = rowSums(x$X)
  list(infl = infl, id = id, Xid = Xid, abunds=abunds, libsizes=libsizes)
},2)
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
lapply(names(infl2), function(x){
  with(infl2[[x]], plot(abunds, colSums(id), log="x", main=x))
})
#In the second dimension, larger abundance means larger influence on the psis too, and no outliers
lapply(names(infl2), function(x){
  with(infl2[[x]], plot(rep(abunds, nrow(infl)), c(t(infl)), log="x", main=x, xlab="abundance",ylab = "Influence")) #Very heavy!
}) #Outlier in unifmarg weigthing scheme
lapply(names(infl2), function(x){
  with(infl2[[x]], plot(rep(libsizes, ncol(infl)), c(infl), log="x", main=x, xlab="Library size",ylab = "Influence")) #Very heavy! #No trend in terms of library sizes visible from here, but their distribution should be log-normal perhaps
})
#Expectations
lapply(names(infl2), function(x){
  with(infl2[[x]], {rbind(quantile(outer(libsizes, abunds)),
       quantile(outer(libsizes, abunds)[id])) })
})
lapply(names(infl2), function(x){
  cat(x, "\n")
  with(infl2[[x]], tLUle(Xid))
})
```

The most influential observations are zero counts in highly abundant species and high libsizes (i.e. high expectations)! Note that we cen derive this from the influence function that does not even depend on the weights!

Influence on the colScores

```{r LU influence colscores, eval=FALSE, purl = FALSE}
inflColList1 = lapply(solListWSLU, function(x){
  try(with(x, NBcolInfl(X, psis, cMat, rMat,thetas , colWeights = if(is.matrix(colWeights)) colWeights else{ cbind(colWeights, colWeights, colWeights)} , k=1 , lambdaCol)))
})
#Look at the signal from the first group
Id1 = which(taxaSigNBLU=="Signal 1")[1]

inflCol1 = lapply(inflColList1, function(x){getInflCol(x$score, x$InvJac, Id1)}) 
lapply(inflCol1, function(x){
  boxplot(x[,Id1]~sampleSigNBLU, las=2, ylab="Influence")
})
```

As expected, the samples with the signal have the highest impact on the score

```{r LU influence rowscores LU, eval=FALSE, purl = FALSE}
inflRowList1 = lapply(solListWSLU, function(x){
  try(with(x, NBrowInfl(X, psis, cMat, rMat,thetas , rowWeights , k=1 , lambdaRow)))
})
#Only look at most extreme colscores
#Cannot calculate influence functions for the interesting cases (with the outliers)
inflRowList1=inflRowList1[sapply(inflRowList1, class)=="list"]
#The influence on the first row score
 
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
idRow = 10
libSizes = rowSums(solListWSLU[[1]]$X)
inflRow1 = lapply(inflRowList1, function(x){getInflRow(x$score, x$InvJac, idRow)})

  plot(y=inflRow1[[x]][,idRow], libSizes, log="x", main=x, col=(libSizes ==libSizes[idRow])+1, ylab="Influence")
})
```

Evidently, the observation from the sample itself has the largest influence. In the marginal weighting scheme for the libsizes, the larger libsizes sometimes get a larger influence, although the effect may be small.

Achieved tolerances

```{r toleranceslu, eval=FALSE, purl = FALSE}

par(mfrow=c(1,3))
lapply(tolAchPsi, function(x){plot(x, log="y");LUline(h=0.01, col="red"); abline(h=0.001, col="blue")})

with(syntNBSigmargmarg_LU,plot(psiRec[3,1:iter[3]])) #Weird jumps, don't stop too early!
```

#### Real data examples

Finally we also apply the method to real datasets

```{r RC(M)_NB real datasets, purl = FALSE}

sapply(resListRCM,function(x){x$converged}) # All converged
sapply(resListRCM,function(x){x$runtime})
sapply(resListRCM,function(x){x$iter})
```

The HMP dataset

```{r HMP plot, purl = FALSE}
SClevels  = unique(c(unlist(sapply(physeqListV13, function(x){
  levels(get_variable("RUNCENTER",physeq=x))

palette(cols)
physeqListV13_SC = lapply(physeqListV13, function(x){
  sample_data(x)[["RUNCENTER"]] = factor(sample_data(x)[["RUNCENTER"]], levels = SClevels, labels = SClevels)
  x
})

phyList = c(AGP = AGphylo, physeqListV13_SC)

```

We've discovered a clear impact of the runcenter!
Now let's filter out the impact of this variable

```{r HMP filter out variable effect, purl=FALSE}

#Group the runcenters together

RCMhmpFilt = lapply(physeqListV13, function(x){

runcenters[["RUNCENTER"]][runcenters[["RUNCENTER"]] %in% c("WUGC,JCVI","WUGC","WUGC,BCM")] = "WUGC"
sample_data(x) = data.frame(sample_data(x) ,RUNCENTER2 = runcenters[[1]])
x})

physeq = RCMhmpFilt[["Buccal.mucosa"]]

The AGP dataset

```{r AGPplots, purl = FALSE}
par(mfrow = c(3,3))
AGPvars = c("IBD","AGE","SEX","PREGNANT","LACTOSE","ASTHMA","DIABETES", "DIET_TYPE","COUNTRY")

plotRCM(resListRCM[["AGP"]], biplot=FALSE, samColour = x, main=x, libInset = c(-2.9,-0.1), libLeg=TRUE)
})
```

The AGP dataset is presumably too noisy to find much of a signal

```{r fitting process, purl = FALSE}
lapply(names(resListRCM), function(x){with(resListRCM[[x]],{ plot(main=x, rowRec[2,1,1:iter[1]])})})
```

AGP is known to be very noisy and does not yield anything.

The Zeller data

```{r load zeller RC(M) NB results, purl = FALSE}

zellers = c("zellerMeta","zeller16S")
# zellerRCM  = lapply(paste(zellers, "RCM.RData"), function(x){

if(!file.exists("zellerSphyRCM.RData")){

names(zellerRCM) = zellers

sapply(zellerRCM,function(x){x$converged}) # All converged

# zellerRCM[[1]]$physeq = zellerMphy

cols = c("darkblue","orange","darkgreen", "brown","black", "blue","magenta","cadetblue","cyan", "yellow", "grey80","grey70","pink")

sapply(names(zellerRCM), function(x){plotRCM(zellerRCM[[x]], biplot=FALSE, samColour = y, main=paste(x,y, collapse="_"))})
})
```

For the 16S data we see signals for Country and Cancer diagnosis. For the metagenomics data we do not see a trend. Notice we are doing indirect gradient analysis again, but this is just to look for confirmation that the unconstrained analysis is detecting true groups.

```{r plotZellerSphy, purl = FALSE}
PCbiplot(zellerMphyRCM, colour = "Age")
PCbiplot(zellerMphyRCM, colour = "BMI")

# Method evaluation

After implementing the method and proving its concept, it is time to compare it with existing methodologies. We need to define a way to obtain datasets, and a way to evaluate the ordinations in a high-throughput way.

## Unconstrained RC(M)

### Generating datasets

As ways of generating test datasets we see three different options

  1) Parametric simulation with the negative binomial with known abundances. 
  2) Non-parametric simulation with SimSeq
  3) Real datasets with biological signal allegedly known
  
  Parametric simulation is needed as a first check but evidently favours our method (if we use the negative binomial distribution). SimSeq is a reasonably neutral tool, we will only use WMW to obtain the lfdr. Real datasets will need to complement our analysis but it may not be possible to evaluate them in a high-throughput way, this will need to happen empirically.
  
#### Parametric simulations

##### Negative binomial

The negative binomial is the assumed distribution of our method. As a result we should outperform all other methods in this setting.

###### Simulate from different distributions

In this setting we will simulate data from 4 unrelated negative binomial distributions. Because of this clustering should be very good.

```{r NBunrelatedDistr, purl = FALSE}
p = 1000 #Number of taxa
n = 60 #Number of samples
nPop = 4 #Number of underlying populations
nPerPop = n/nPop #Number of samples per population
reps = 100 #replicates
nDim  = 3 #Number of dimensions

load("/home/stijn/PhD/Simulations/data/MLES.RData") #Load observed parameter values
rhoEst = unlist(rhoMLEs) #observed relative abundances, pooled
thetaEst = 1/unlist(phiMLEs) #observed dispersions abundances, pooled

groupInd = rep(1:nPop, each = nPerPop) #Group indicator, as integers
groupFactor = factor(groupInd, levels = 1:nPop, labels =  paste("Population", 1:nPop), ordered = TRUE) #as factor

#Library sizes
load("/home/stijn/PhD/Simulations/data/physeqListV13.RData")
libSizesEst = unlist(sapply(physeqListV13, sample_sums)) #Resample

if(!file.exists(file = "simRCMunconstr1.RData")){
datList1 = mclapply(mc.cores=4, 1:reps, function(i){
## Sample parameters
rhosSampled = sapply(1:nPop, function(x){sample(rhoEst, p)})[,groupInd]
thetasSampled = sample(thetaEst, p) #Sampled dispersions are the same in every population, this is the ideal case assumed by our method.
libSizesSampled = sample(libSizesEst, n) #Sampled libSizes

## Create dataset
meanMat = libSizesSampled * t(rhosSampled)
dataMat = matrix(rnbinom(prod(dim(meanMat)), mu = meanMat, size = matrix(thetasSampled,n,p)),n,p)
list(dataMat = dataMat, group = groupFactor, libSizesSampled = libSizesSampled, thetasSampled = thetasSampled, rhosSampled = rhosSampled)
})

RCMresList1 = mclapply(mc.cores=4, datList1, function(y){
  RCM(y$dataMat, k = nDim, distribution = "NB")
})
save(RCMresList1, groupFactor, file = "simRCMunconstr1.RData")
} else {load(file = "simRCMunconstr1.RData")}
```
  
### Evaluating the biplot

For the simulation we will need multiple repetitions to prove the superiority of our method, so we need an automatic evaluation of the clustering accuracy.

#### Within vs. overall distance

A first intuitive approach would be to compare the within cluster distances on the plot to the distances to the origin. Clusters are defined as samples generated with the same taxon distribution, either parametrically or non-parametrically. Say we have $m = 1,...,l$ groups with (multidimensional) means $\mathbf{M}_m$.  The within distance is then defined as $d_{m, within} = \frac{1}{n_m}\sum_{i=1}^{n_m} d_{euclidean}(\mathbf{M}_m, Y_i)$, with $d_{euclidean}$ the euclidean distance. The overall distance of a group then equals $d_{m, overall} = \frac{1}{n_m}\sum_{i=1}^{n_m} d_{euclidean}(\mathbf{0}, Y_i)$ with $\mathbf{0}$ the origin. This calculation can be done for each dimension separately or in the multidimensional space.

We could perhaps look for the distance based method that minimizes $\frac{d_{m, within}}{d_{m, overall}}$?

This approach can be applied to the row scores (samples) as well as the column scores (taxa).

#### Correlation with library sizes

The motivating problem to develop the whole method was to find an approach that would not show correlation between the row scores and the library sizes, which is a technical artefact.

(Absolute values of) Pearson and/or Spearman correlations of row scores with library sizes could be another criterion to evaluate the quality of the biplot.

<!---
The between distance between groups m and m' is then defined as $d_{mm'} = d_{euclidean}(\mathbf{M}_m, \mathbf{M}_{m'})$ with $d_{euclidean}$ the euclidean distance.

#### Some comments on analysing microbiome count data

##### Do not log-transform count data

- log-transforms come with arbitrary pseudocounts for the many zeroes
- models based on transformed data are hard to interpret in funcion of the untransformed data
- log-transformation does not stabilize the variance
- Accept non-normality and heteroscedasticity instead of trying to transform them away!
- Log-transformation is more robust though and provides better type I error control (see papers O'Hara 2010, Ives 2015, Warton 2016 and this [post](http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/114848/negative-binomial-glm-vs-log-transforming-for-count-data-increased-type-i-erro?rq=1) )

##### Do not rely on residuals-based approaches

- Most residual based approaches rely on normally behaved residuals
- Microbiome residuals are skewed to the right 
- The expectations should be larger than or equal to 5 for this approximation to hold, which is not the case for the majority of microbiome entries

##### Use a GLM

- Normalizing to relative or rarefied abundances throws away information on the variance and valuable counts
- Leave the data untransformed and use a proper GLM for counts! This will properly model mean and variance and allows incorporation of covariate information
