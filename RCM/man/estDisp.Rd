\title{A function to estimate the overdispersion of the negative binomial distribution. Hereby information between taxa is shared with empirical Bayes using the edgeR pacakage, where the time-limiting steps are programmed in C.}
\usage{
estDisp(X, cMat = NULL, rMat = NULL, muMarg, psis,
  trended.dispersion = NULL, prior.df = 10, dispWeights = NULL,
  rowMat = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{cMat}{a 1xp colum scores matrix}

\item{rMat}{a nx1 rowscores matrix, if unconstrained}

\item{muMarg}{an nxp offset matrix}

\item{psis}{a scalar, the current psi estimate}

\item{trended.dispersion}{a vector of length p with pre-calculated trended.dispersion estimates. They do not vary in function of the offset anyway}

\item{prior.df}{an integer, number of degrees of freedom of the prior for the Bayesian shrinkage}

\item{dispWeights}{Weights for estimating the dispersion in a zero-inflated model}

\item{rowMat}{matrix of row scores in case of constrained ordination}

\item{X:}{the data matrix of dimensions nxp}
}
\value{
A vector of length p with dispersion estimates
}
