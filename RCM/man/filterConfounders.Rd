\title{Filters out the effect of known confounders. This is done by fitting interactions of every taxon with the levels of the confounders. It returns a modified offset matrix for the remainder of the fitting procedure.}
\usage{
filterConfounders(muMarg, confMat, X, thetas, p, n, nleqslv.control,
  trended.dispersion, tol = 0.001, maxIt = 20)
}
\arguments{
\item{muMarg}{a nxp matrix, the current offset}

\item{X}{the nxp data matrix}

\item{thetas}{a vector of length p with the current dispersion estimates}

\item{p}{an integer, the number of columns of X}

\item{n}{an integer, the number of rows of X}

\item{tol}{a scalar, the convergence tolerance}

\item{maxIt}{maximum number of iterations

Fits the negative binomial mean parameters and overdispersion parameters iteratively. Convergence is determined based on the L2-norm of the absolute change of mean parameters}

\item{confounders}{a nxt confounder matrix}
}
\value{
a list with components:
\item{thetas}{new theta estimates}
\item{muMarg}{a new offset matrix}
\item{NB_params}{The estimated parameters of the interaction terms}
}
