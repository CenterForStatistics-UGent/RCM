\arguments{
\item{x}{an RCM object}

\item{...}{further arguments, passed on to the ggplot() function}

\item{Dim}{A vector two dimensions to plot, defaults to the first two}

\item{samColour}{a character string, the variable to use for the colour of the sample dots}

\item{colLegend}{a character string, the legend text for the sample colour. Defaults to the name of the colour variable}

\item{samShape}{a character string, the variable to use for the shape of the sample dots}

\item{shapeLegend}{a character string, the text to use for the shapeLegend. Defaults to the name of the shape variable}

\item{samSize}{a scalar, the size of the sample dots}

\item{taxNum}{an integer, the number of taxa to be plotted}

\item{scalingFactor}{a scalar, a user supplied scaling factor for the taxon arrows If not supplied it will be calculated to make sample and taxon plots on the same scale}

\item{plotType}{a character string: which components to plots}

\item{quadDrop}{a number between 0 and 1. At this fraction of the peak height are the ellipses of the quadratic response functions drawn}

\item{nPoints}{an integer, number of points to evaluate for the ellipse}

\item{plotEllipse}{a boolean, whether to add the ellipses}

\item{taxaScale}{a scalar, by which to scale the rectangles of the quadratic taxon plot}

\item{Palette}{the colour palette}

\item{taxLabels}{a boolean, shoudl taxon labels be plotted}

\item{taxDots}{a boolean, should taxa be plotted as dots?}

\item{taxCol}{the taxon colour}

\item{taxColSingle}{the taxon colour if there is only one}

\item{nudge_y}{a scalar, the offet for the taxon labels}

\item{square}{A boolean, should the plot be square? This is highly preferred to honestly represent differences}

\item{xInd}{a scalar or a vector of length 2, specifying the indentation left and right of the plot to allow for the labels to be printed entirely. Defaults to 0.75 at every side}

\item{yInd}{a scalar or a vector of length 2, specifying the indentation top and bottom of the plot to allow for the labels to be printed entirely. Defaults to 0 at every side}

\item{labSize}{the size of the variable labels}

\item{taxRegExp}{a character vector indicating which taxa to plot}

\item{varNum}{an integer, number of variable arrows to draw}

\item{alpha}{a boolean, should small arrows be made transparent?}

\item{alphaRange}{The range of transparency}

\item{arrowSize}{a scalar, the size of the arrows}

\item{Influence}{a boolean, should the influence of the observation on the variable be plotted}

\item{inflDim}{an integer, the dimension for which the influence should be calculated}

\item{richSupported}{A character vector of supported richness measures}

\item{returnCoords}{a boolea, should final coordinates be returned?}

\item{varExpFactor}{a scalar, the factor by which to expand the variable coordinates}

\item{manExpFactorTaxa}{a manual expansion factor for the taxa Setting it to a high value allows you to plot the taxa around the samples}

\item{nPhyl}{an integer, number of phylogenetic levels to show}

\item{phylOther}{a character vector of phylogenetic levels to be included in the "other" group}

\item{legendSize}{a size for the coloured dots in the legend}

\item{noLegend}{a boolean indicating you do not want a legend}

\item{crossSize}{the size of the central cross}

\item{contCol}{a character vector of length two, giving the low and high values of the continuous colour scale}
