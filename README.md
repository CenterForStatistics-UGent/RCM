# RCM

This repo contains R-code to fit and plot the RC(M)-models augmented with the negative binomial (which might be used in a later R-package) in the "R" folder. Moreover there is the "RC(M).Rmd" file with theoretical discussions, real data analyis and simulation results. The functions used for simulation but which are outside outside the core RC(M) algorithm are present in the "pubFun" folder.

The "ZIandSimCode.Rmd" file contains code to fit the ZI components as well and old simulation code.
