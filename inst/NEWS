0.2.0
=====

-   Importance parameters *ψ* are no longer calculated when non-parametric response functions are used.

0.3.0
=====

-   Importance parameters *ψ* are enabled again when non-parametric response functions are used, but not used for plotting.
-   2D sample plots for constrained ordination with non-parametric response functions have been disabled, as they are not interpretable. Variable plots are the only 2D plots still allowed
-   Explained deviance and inertia can be plotted on the axes rahter than the *ψ*'s using the "plotPsi" argument to the plot.RCM() function.
-   Possibility to provide lower dimensional fits has been disabled. *RCM* is fast enough to fit the whole model.
