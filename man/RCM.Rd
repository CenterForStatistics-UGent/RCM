\usage{
RCM(dat, ...)

\S4method{RCM}{phyloseq}(dat, covariates = NULL, confounders = NULL,
  ...)

\S4method{RCM}{matrix}(dat, k = 2, round = FALSE, prevCutOff = 0.05,
  minFraction = 0.1, rowWeights = "uniform", colWeights = "marginal",
  confModelMat = NULL, confTrimMat = NULL, covModelMat = NULL,
  centMat = NULL, allowMissingness = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{an nxp count matrix or a phyloseq object with an otu_table slot}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed on to the RCM.NB() function}

\item{covariates}{In case 'dat' is a phyloseq object,
the names of the sample
  variables to be used as covariates in the constrained analysis,
   or 'all' to
  indicate all variables to be used.
  In case 'dat' is a matrix, a nxf matrix
  or dataframe of covariates.
   Character variables will be converted to
  factors, with a warning. Defaults to NULL,
  in which case an unconstrained
  analysis is carried out.}

\item{confounders}{In case 'dat' is a phyloseq object,
the names of the sample variables to be used as confounders
 to be filtered
 out. In case 'dat' is a matrix, a nxf dataframe
 of confounders.
  Character variables will be converted to factors, with a warning.
  Defaults to NULL, in which case no filtering occurs.}

\item{k}{an integer, the number of dimensions of the RCM solution}

\item{round}{a boolean, whether to round to nearest integer. Defaults to
FALSE.}

\item{prevCutOff}{a scalar, the prevalance cutoff for the trimming.
Defaults to 2.5e-2}

\item{minFraction}{a scalar, each taxon's total abundance
should equal
 at least the number of samples n times minFraction,
  otherwise it is trimmed.
  Defaults to 10\%}

\item{rowWeights, colWeights}{character strings,
the weighting procedures for the normalization of row and column scores.
 Defaults to 'uniform' and 'marginal' respectively}

\item{confTrimMat, confModelMat, covModelMat, centMat}{Dedicated model matrices
constructed based on phyloseq object.}

\item{allowMissingness}{A boolean, should NA values be tolerated?}

\description{
This is a wrapper function,
which currently only fits the negative binomial distribution,
but which could easily be extended to other ones.
}
\details{
This function should be called on a raw count matrix,
without rarefying or normalization to proportions.
This functions trims on prevalence and total abundance to avoid instability
of the algorithm. Covariate and confounder matrices are constructed,
so that everything is passed on
 to the workhorse function RCM.NB() as matrices.
