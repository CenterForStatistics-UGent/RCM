\item{tol}{a scalar, the relative convergende tolerance for the row scores and column scores parameters.}

\item{nleqslv.control}{a list with control options, see nleqslv}

\item{jacMethod}{Method for solving non-linear equations, ?see nleqslv. Defaults to Broyden. The difference with the newton method is that the Jacobian is not recalculated at every iteration, thereby speeding up the algorithm}

\item{dispFreq}{an integer, how many iterations the algorithm should wait before reestimationg the dispersions.}

\item{convNorm}{a scalar, the norm to use to determine convergence}

\item{prior.df}{an integer, see estDisp()}

\item{marginEst}{a character string, either "MLE" or "marginSums", indicating how the independence model should be estimated}

\item{confounders}{a list with
-confounders an nxg matrix with confounders
-confoundersFilt an nxh matrix with confounders for filtering, with all levels and without intercept}

\item{prevCutOff}{a scalar the minimum prevalence needed to retain a taxon before the the confounder filtering}

\item{minFraction}{a scalar, total taxon abundance should equal minFraction*n if it wants to be retained before the confounder filtering}

\item{covariates}{an nxd matrix with covariates. If set to null an unconstrained analysis is carried out, otherwise a constrained one. Factors must have been converted to dummy variables already}

\item{centMat}{a fxd matrix containing the contrasts to center the categorical variables. f equals the number of continuous variables + the total number of levels of the categorical variables.}

\item{responseFun}{a characters string indicating the shape of the response function}

\item{record}{A boolean, should intermediate parameter estimates be stored?}

\item{control.outer}{a list of control options for the outer loop constrOptim.nl function}

\item{envGradEst}{a character string, indicating how the environmental gradient should be fitted. "LR" using the likelihood-ratio criterion, or "ML" a full maximum likelihood solution}

\item{dfSpline}{a scalar, the number of degrees of freedom for the splines of the non-parametric response function, see VGAM::s()}

\item{vgamMaxit}{an integer, the maximum number of iteration in the vgam() function}

\item{degree}{an integer, the degree of the polynomial fit if the spline fit fails
