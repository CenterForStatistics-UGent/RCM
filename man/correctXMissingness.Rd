\title{Replace missing entries in X by their expectation to set their
contribution to the estimating equations to zero}
\usage{
correctXMissingness(X, mu, allowMissingness, naId)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{the matrix of counts}

\item{mu}{the matrix of expectations}

\item{allowMissingness}{A boolean, are missing values present}

\item{naId}{The numeric index of the missing values in X}
}
\value{
The matrix X with the NA entries replaced by the
corresponding entries in mu
}
\description{
Replace missing entries in X by their expectation to set their
contribution to the estimating equations to zero
}
\note{
This may seem like a hacky approach, but it avoids having to deal
 with NAs in functions like crossprod().
