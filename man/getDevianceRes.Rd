\title{A function to calculate the matrix of deviance residuals from a RCM object.}
\usage{
getDevianceRes(RCM, Dim = seq_len(RCM$k))
}
\arguments{
\item{RCM}{an RCM object}

\item{Dim}{The dimensions to use

For the deviance residuals we use the overdispersions from the reduced model.
Standard dimensions used are only first and second, since these are also plotted}
}
\value{
A matrix with deviance residuals of the same size as the original data matrix
}
