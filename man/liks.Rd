\title{Calculate the log-likelihoods of the indepence and saturated models and all fitted submodels}
\usage{
liks(rcm, Sum = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{rcm}{an object of the RCM class}

\item{Sum}{a boolean, should log-likelihoods be summed?

Dispersions are re-estimated for every dimension of the model.}
}
\value{
If Sum is FALSE, a named array log-likelihoods of the independence model and all models with dimension 1 to k, including after filtering on confounders. Otherwise a table with log-likelihoods, deviance explained and cumulative deviance explained.
