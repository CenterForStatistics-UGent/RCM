\title{A function to efficiently row multiply a a-by-b matrix by a vector of length b. More memory intensive but that does not matter with given matrix sizes}
\usage{
rowMultiply(matrix, vector)
}
\arguments{
\item{matrix}{a numeric matrix of dimension a-by-b}

\item{vector}{a numeric vector of length b

t(t(matrix)*vector) but then faster}
}
\value{
a matrix, row multplied by the vector
}
