#' A function to generate datasets non-parametrically based on lfdr's from Wilcoxon rank sum tests
#'
#' @param testRes A result from the testSimSeq() function
#' @param Ntaxa The total number of taxa in the final dataset. Defaults to the same as the original dataset
#' @param fracTaxa the fraction of taxa to be made differentially abundant
#'
#' @return a list with componenents
#' \item{data}{The newly generated dataset}
#' \item{treatment}{The grouping vector}
#' \item{DEtaxa}{A character vector fo taxa made differenatially abundant}
